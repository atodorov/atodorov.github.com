I am working on several projects and I'm usually affiliated with more than one
organization at any given time. This list contains my current projects and
some of the more interesting previous ones.

Difio

[Difio](http://www.dif.io) is my latest project. This is a service targeted at developers
who use open source packages and libraries. Difio keeps track of application dependencies
and tells you when they change. It lets you inspect the changes and make informed decision
when or what to upgrade because even if an application works, any change in its libraries
or the versions of those libraries can break the application.


Open Technologies Bulgaria
---------------------------

!["OTB"](/images/logos/otb.png "OTB")

[Open Technologies Bulgaria, Ltd](http://otb.bg) is a company I founded in 2009 which
mainly does open source consulting for some local clients and QA services to Red Hat, Inc. It's
also an authorized
[Red Hat re-seller in Bulgaria](http://redhat.force.com/finder/PFPartnerDetail?id=0016000000LxykhAAB).


Red Hat
-------

[Red Hat, Inc.](http://redhat.com) is the largest enterprise Linux vendor as you probably know.
I used to work for them as an employee and still continue to do so as a contractor. My main responsibility
is making sure Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and some other products) get to customers without too
many bugs and behave as quality software. I'm highly biased towards all Red Hat products but
a) they didn't fail me once and b) I know how much hard work is done into making these products
kick ass.


One Laptop Per Child Bulgarian Chapter
--------------------------------------

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="/images/logos/olpcbg.png" alt="OLPC.bg" />

[OLPC](http://laptop.org) was a project to build an entirely new laptop device and software for the children
in developing countries. I was a co-founder of the Bulgarian chapter of this project.
While the upstream project delivered a hardware and a software platform it failed rather miserably.
Our local chapter didn't get much support and gradually ceased operations.
