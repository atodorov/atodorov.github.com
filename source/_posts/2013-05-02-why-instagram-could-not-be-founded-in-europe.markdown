*Can a company like Instagram be founded in Europe and successfully exit for
$ 1 billion?* What do you think ?

This is precisely the question [Bart≈Çomiej Gola](http://speedupgroup.com/about-us/)
asked at WebIT BG last week. Here are his answers.


Theory says yes
----------------

In theory Europe is well suited for successful companies:

* We have talented software engineers and hackers;
* Great ideas are available everywhere;
* Funding is available - both early stage seed funding as well
as VCs.


Forget about it
---------------

The short answer though is "forget about it"! There are several
major differences between Europe and Silicon Valley which
could break your start-up easily.

1) Europe doesn't have a strong branding with respect to technology.
We are not perceived as a strong tech community which produces great things.
Not to mention individual countries like Bulgaria.
This means foreign investors are
less likely to invest in European companies because they haven't heard
about other successful companies coming from the region.

We as a community should work together and popularize the region
(especially South Eastern Europe). I've seen this already in action.
German cloud provider [cloudControl](http://cloudcontrol.de) has
branded their website as "Proudly Made In Berlin".

2) The lack of reputation leads to the second issue - less followers
on social media. Think about it! How many people in the US or Silicon Valley
do you follow on Twitter? How many follow you back? How many of those who
do, actually engage with what you share? 

With some exceptions like my friend [Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) your
social reach is quite limited when it comes to hi-tech users.

3) Less reputation plus less social reach means less buzz and less early
adopters. Silicon Valley is a great place to generate buzz and find
early adopters. Because of the software industry and many start-ups
located in the area people generally have more open mindset and
will try out new ideas, share valuable feedback, engage in social media
and spread the word.

Early adopters are crucial for every start-up. And we don't have this 
mindset in Europe. I have seen it myself. From 400 friends and co-workers
whom I've contacted via LinkedIn, half or more of them in Europe,
only a few, not even a dozen have tried [Difio](http://www.dif.io).
And we are talking about service from developers about developers. Nada.

I've tried another experiment as well. This time about non IT business.
From around 100 female friends on Facebook around 10 followed a 
[Facebook page](http://facebook.com/obuvki41plus)
which I've invited them to. The page is 
[online ladies shoes shop](http://obuvki41plus.com).


What to do about it?
--------------------

I don't have a clear answer here. We need to work hard and
make Europe and Bulgaria well known in the software industry
and start-up community. I encourage everyone to try, fail, try, fail
and try until they succeed. And brag about what you do all the time.

This also prompted me another question. "How do companies in the Bulgarian
start-up eco-system find their early adopters?" I think I'm gonna start
a new blog category  dedicated to this topic.
