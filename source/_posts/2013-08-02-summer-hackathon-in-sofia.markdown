A [summer hackathon](http://hackfmi.com/spontanen-leten-hachathon/)
will be held in Sofia between 16th and 22nd of August. The week prior to the
event (12th to 15th) will be full of lectures and workshops to prepare the students
for their task.

The goal this time is to create a new system for the Student Council organization
which will host their new website and also provide more transparency into the 
organization and the work they do. The idea is initiated by the chairman of the
council which is quite surprising for me to hear. You can read his motivation
(in Bulgarian) [here](https://github.com/Hackfmi/SummerHackathon/blob/master/motivation.md).

At the moment it is agreed that the system will be written in Python and Django
and this is where I join. Together with Kiril Vladimirov I will be leading the
Python/Django lecture and workshop in one of the days, likely 14th of August.

The program is not yet finalized so I can't share more info. Please watch this
space for more details when they are available.
