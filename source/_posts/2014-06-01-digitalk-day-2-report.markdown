Continuing to report on the last few events that took place in Sofia this week.

Day #2 of DigitalK started with the presentation of Piotr Jas of BlaBla Car.
What I really liked about it (picture TBA) was one particular graph depicting
the various types of travel (time before travel vs. cost of travel) and
visualizing different industries (e.g. air travel) or competitor companies.
The image clearly exhibited a blank space which is the exact market segment
where BlaBla Car have positioned themselves in.

A very practical and easy to use tool for entrepreneurs in my opinion.

From the rest of the keynotes I can outline two in particular:
Ivan Hernandez' *Disruptive Innovation and the future of Digital Transformation*
and *The future of Tech and Communities* by Tim RÃ¶hrich.

I liked them because both were very inspirational although not telling you
something which you haven't heard before. They were basically reinforcing
the spirit of the event.

In the small hall there was a workshop called 
*How to turn a good idea into a successful start-up* led by Daniela Neumann,
which didn't turn out to be what I expected. She was talking about the early
cycle of idea/customer validation and I don't remember any particular example
being shown. Frankly most of the people have heard about this before (myself included)
and were quite bored. Not many of them stayed till the end.


The evening continued with the already traditional Silicon Drinkabout in Sofia
which hosted many of the conference attendees. I did a quick visit only
because I had to prepare myself for Bulgaria Web Summit on the next day!
