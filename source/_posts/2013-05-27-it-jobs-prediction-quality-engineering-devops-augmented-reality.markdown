Tomorrow I'm taking part in a discussion at Sofia University targeted towards
young students. Speakers are well-known IT professionals and I'm honored to be invited.

One of the preliminary questions posted from students is

{% blockquote %}
In which field to expect saturation of junior specialists in the next 5 years?
Which technologies will see higher demand and which will not?
{% endblockquote %}

While I don't have a clear answer here are my favorites and comments. If I was a 20 year old
student I would definitely be paying attention to these. 

Quality Engineering, Quality Assurance, Test Automation
--------------------------------------------------------

The more software gets written, the more critical the need to test it.
In the past 6+ years I've been working in the field of QA and saw 5x rise in
the workload and number of team members I've been working with. Traditionally
Bulgaria is strong on the development side but lacks trained QA engineers.
In the past I have also been approached by several foreign companies to train
their QA staff and organize their QA processes. The situation here is not very
different even today. 

If you want a secure job become a top-notch QA with experience ranging from
test automation, QA management, bug finding and all between. Strongly recommended
is to get some industry recognized certificates (I don't have such for QA). 

DevOps
------

Looks like [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is the new mantra.
With advancement of cloud technologies and everything becoming as-a-service
my gut is telling me that more and more organization will be switching to DevOps
types of operations in an attempt to be faster, more cost effective and more agile.
I myself am looking into this field. 

While I haven't done a formal research to back-up my words I think DevOps will be
a hot topic in the next 5 years until it becomes the norm. Acquire DevOps skills
if you are particularly interested in working for start-ups or small engineering
organizations serving large customer bases (e.g Disqus, GitHub, The Guardian).

Augmented Reality
------------------

[AR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) is not a fiction anymore. 
We have everything we need to make use of it in everyday life and it's slowly 
[becoming mainstream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass).
If you are into maths, algorithms and research then this is your field. Couple
with mobile devices, social networks, big data and cloud and you have a job
for a life time. 


What else?
----------

I don't have a crystal ball to predict the future. It could be that my IT jobs
predictions are totally wrong. Let me know what do you think. If you were in the
beginning of your career which fields will you bet on?
