Hi everyone and welcome to my blog! My name is Alex and you can read more [about me](/about/)
if you like.

After several years of rather unsuccessful blogging I decided to revamp my blog.
I'm starting fresh with new domain name and a big list of topics to write about. This blog will
be the place to share my thoughts on open source software, QA and cloud. From time to time
I intend to write about start-ups and being a start-up owner as well.

I hope you find it interesting and helpful.
