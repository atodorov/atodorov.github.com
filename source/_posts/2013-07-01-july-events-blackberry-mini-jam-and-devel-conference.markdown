If you happen to be on holiday in Bulgaria but would still like to meet
some hackers there are three events this month that I find interesting:
Plovdiv Conf, BlackBerry Mini Developer Jam and Varna Conf.

Plovdiv Conf
------------

[Plovdiv Conf](http://plovdivconf.com/) will be held at the Plovdiv Fair
on July 6th 2013. There isn't an official program but the speaker profiles are
interesting. Among them are guys well known for their Ruby and Linux skills.

From the given list I recognize only half the names. One speaker that sounds
interesting to me claims experience with programming assembler for the mainframe.

My friend [Alexander Kurtakov](http://akurtakov.blogspot.com/) from Red Hat/Eclipse
will be there as well so I'm planning to attend this event.


BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia
----------------------------

Organized by BlackBerry Developer Group Balkan the 
[BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia](http://bb10jamsofia2013.eventbrite.com/) will be held
on July 11th 2013 at [betahaus Sofia](http://betahaus.bg). Last time I visited
a [BlackBerry developers session](/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/) it
was very interesting. 

My personal interest at the moment is not developing mobile applications but I'd like to hear
more about the possibilities. My understanding is that BlackBerry 10 is much more flexible
as a development platform compared to Android and iOS. 

I will definitely attend this event because there will be a shiny new **BlackBerry Z 10**
waiting for me there :). I will tell you how to secure one after I get it. 


Varna Conf
----------

[Varna Conf](http://varnaconf.com/) is organized by the same people who do Plovdiv Conf.
It will be held on July 20th 2013 at Cherno More hotel in Varna.

Most of the speakers I don't know but there are couple of topics about testing and refactoring
which look interesting. However I will be more likely to socialize with the local development
groups rather than listening to all talks.

I'm not sure if I will attend though. My initial plan was to attend but there are other personal
errands that are popping up. Given that it is not near Sofia I will probably skip it.

If you happen
to be on holiday at the Bulgarian sea side however, you should definitely check it out. And Varna is
a very nice city too.



Let me know if there are other interesting events in the vicinity! Use the comments and tell me where
are you going this month.
