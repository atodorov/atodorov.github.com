My name is Alexander Todorov and this is how I look according to a friend of mine.
I'm currently living in Sofia, Bulgaria but I have lived in Brno, Czech Republic as well.

I'm currently a contractor operating in the field of open source software and
quality engineering among many things. I'm also running some start-up projects
of my own.

My professional interests cover vast amount of topics including but not limited
to Linux and open source, quality engineering, DevOps, cloud and
platform-as-a-service, programming with Python and Django.

I used to teach to students at Technical University Of Sofia with my friends
[Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) and [Kiril Kamburov](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/kirilkamburov)
but I don't have the time for this anymore. I still speak at conferences from time to time though.

You can always ping me if you'd like to chat or have a beer. See <http://about.me/atodorov>
