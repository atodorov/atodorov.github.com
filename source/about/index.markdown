My name is Alexander Todorov and this is how I look. It's pretty close!

I'm currently a contractor operating in the field of open source software and
quality engineering and a start-up owner with many ideas.
I also have some hard-earned certificates including:

* RHCE - Red Hat Certified Engineer - Oct 2008
* RHCI - Red Hat Certified Instructor - Oct 2009
* RHCVA - Red Hat Certified Virtualization Administrator - Sep 2010
* Red Hat Partner Platform Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011
* Red Hat Partner Virtualization Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011
* Red Hat Partner Middleware Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011

My professional interests cover vast amount of topics including but not limited
to Linux and open source, quality engineering, DevOps, cloud and
platform-as-a-service, programming with Python and Django.

I used to teach to students at Technical University Of Sofia with my friends
[Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) and [Kiril Kamburov](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/kirilkamburov)
but I don't have the time for this anymore.
