only Krasi's articles and all of them with the same date. The problem was the RSS

                <p><img alt="Initial view" src="/images/qachallenge1.png" title="Initial view" /></p>
<p>Today I wanted to submit a presentation proposal for
<a href="http://qachallengeaccepted.com">QA Challenge Accepted 2016</a> and found a usability
problem in their website. The first picture is how the UI looks on my screen.
As you can see the screen height is enough to show the first section of the
interface. There's something orange at the bottom which isn't clearly identifiable.
The next picture shows the UI as it looks after clicking on the PROGRAM menu link.</p>
<p><img alt="View after clicking the menu" src="/images/qachallenge2.png" title="View after clicking the menu" /></p>
<p>The problem is that I never saw the orange section, which turned out to be
the call for papers and a link to the submission form. To fix this the orange
section either needs to go at the top and be clearly visible or at least a new
item be added to the menu.</p>
<p>Btw the next event will be in March 2016 in Sofia and I hope to see you there!</p>

                    OpenFest 2015 Impressions
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>This past weekend I've attended <a href="http://openfest.org">OpenFest</a> in Sofia. I have
mixed feelings about this year's event. Although I was so tired that I slept
through the entire Monday I find some of the presentations not so interesting.</p>
<h2>Day One</h2>
<p>On the first day I've tried to attend the talk about <em>The Yocto Project</em> by
<a href="http://anavi.org">Leon Anavi</a> and <a href="http://kolev.info">Radoslav Kolev</a>.
The room was full and I couldn't get in so I watched some of it outside
using the live streaming. Next was <em>Building Universal Applications with Angular 2</em> by
<a href="http://blog.mgechev.com">Minko Gechev</a> followed by
<em>Free And Open Source Software In European Public Administrations</em> by
<a href="http://hillenius.com/">Gijs Hillenius</a>.</p>
<p>Overall impression from these talks was good. They were interesting to me
and I liked the way they were presented.</p>
<p>Afterwards I've spend a good hour and more talking to Gijs, catching up on
a long overdue email thread about FOSS usage in Bulgarian public administrations.
It's always nice to put a face on the email address :). The outcome of this
is that I'll have to forward him quite a lot of local contacts. Also my
previous article
<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/10-steps-migrate-your-closed-software-open-source">10 steps to migrate your closed software to open source</a>
is now available at OSOR's website.</p>
<h2>Day Two</h2>
<p>On day two I had quite a few people to talk to but managed to attend couple of
presentations. In the main room <em>First Lessons in Control Theory</em> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/hiro_asari">Hiro Asari</a> and at the end
<em>Collaboration In Open Source - How Does It Really Work?</em> by
<a href="https://twitter.com/ottokekalainen">Otto Kekäläinen</a>. I am quite disappointed
by both, the challenge level wasn't the one I've expected.</p>
<p>Hiro's subject is interesting but IMO he merely scratched the surface.
The first half of the presentation was an introduction in the field
and as far as I could tell most of the people left in the room
didn't need it. The most interesting part was probably the last 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>For Otto's presentation I had the expectation it would be interesting stories
and failures from working with the community. Instead it was an introduction
why and how open source communities work.</p>
<p>That said both presentations are suitable for inexperienced public, folks
who are new to open source or IT in general. For folks like me, who have
been working for 10 years in the open they weren't so interesting.
I'm not against entry-level presentations but at least they have to
be properly annotated as such.</p>
<p>The other presentation I've attended on day two was <em>Education 3.0</em> by
Ivan Gospodinov. This was a non-technical talk which conflicted with
the lightning talks and I've missed 
<a href="/blog/2015/05/20/free-software-testing-books/">mine</a>. I liked this one
though.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>This year the event was held at a new venue which was a pleasant change.
I've heard there were more people attending since previous years yet
it seemed there is less seating capacity at the venue.</p>
<p>The after-party however was very good and just before leaving something
amazing happened to me. A guy comes to me and asks if I'm atodorov.
Obviously I am. Then he says he's my co-worker Vladimir Ralev from Red Hat.
Mind you we've talked many times on IRC but not once seen in person.</p>

                    Building Docker Images with Anaconda
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Anaconda, the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer, has gained some
features to facilitate building Docker images. These are only available
in kickstart. To build a Docker image for HTTPD, using packages provided in the
distro use the following ks.cfg file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">install</span>

<span class="nf">%end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The above kickstart file will:</p>
<ul>
<li>install HTTPD and its dependencies</li>
<li>disable kernel installation by excluding it from the package list</li>
<li>disable installation of the boot loader using <code>--disabled</code>. The resulting image
will not be bootable</li>
<li>disable firewall</li>
<li>locks the root account so it can't login from the console</li>
<li>prevent installing @core using <code>--nocore</code></li>
<li>limit the installation of localization files using <code>--instLangs</code></li>
<li>limit the installation of documentation using <code>--excludedocs</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the previous <code>--nobase</code> option is deprected and doesn't have any effect.</p>
<p>After the VM installation is complete grab the contents of the root directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># virt-tar-out -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/disk.qcow2 / myimage.tar
</pre></div>


<p>Import the tarball into Docker and inspect the result:</p>

<p>As you can see the resulting image is bigger than stock images provided by Red Hat.
At this moment I don't know if this is the minimum package set which satisfies
dependencies or anaconda adds a bit more on its own. The full package list is
given below. There are some packages like  device-mapper, dracut, e2fsprogs,
iptables, kexec-tools, SELinux related, systemd and tzdata which look out
of place. My guess is some of them are pulled in from the various kickstart
commands and not really necessary. I will follow up with devel and see if
the content can be stripped down even more.</p>

            </a>
                <p>In my <a href="/blog/2015/10/15/anaconda-coverage.py-details/">previous post</a>
I've talked about testing anaconda and friends and raised some questions.
Today I'm going to give an example of how to answer one of them:
"How different is the code execution path between different tests?"</p>
<h2>coverate-tools</h2>
<p>I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/coverage-tools">coverage-tools</a>
in my explanations below so a little introduction is required. All the tools
are executable Python scripts which build on top of existing coverage.py API.
The difference is mainly in flexibility of parameters and output formatting.
I've tried to keep as close as possible to the existing behavior of coverage.py.</p>
<p><em>coverage-annotate</em> - when given a .coverage data file prints the source code
annotated with line numbers and execution markers.</p>

<p>In the example above all lines starting with <strong>&gt;</strong> were executed by the interpreter.
All top-level import statements were executed as you would expect. Then the method
<em>get_help_width()</em> was executed (called from somewhere). Because this was on x86_64
machine line 63 was not executed. It is marked with <strong>!</strong>. The comments and empty
lines are of no interest.</p>
<p><em>coverage-diff</em> - produces git like diff reports on the text output of annotate.</p>

<p>In this example line 637 was not executed in the first test run, while it was executed
in the second test run. Reading the comments above it is clear the difference between
the two test runs is just timing and synchronization.</p>
<h2>Kickstart vs. Kickstart</h2>
<p>How different is the code execution path between different tests? Looking at
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Results:Fedora_23_Final_RC3_Installation">Fedora 23 test results</a>
we see several tests which differ only slightly in their setup - installation
via HTTP, FTP or NFS; installation to SATA, SCSI, SAS drives; installation using
RAID for the root file system; These are good candidates for further analysis.</p>
<p>Note: my results below are not from Fedora 23 but the conclusions still apply!
The tests were executed on bare metal and virtual machines, trying to use the
same hardware or same systems configurations where possible!</p>
<p>Example: HTTP vs. FTP</p>

<p>The difference in <code>source.py</code> is from timing/synchronization and can safely be ignored.
I'm not exactly sure about <code>__init__.py</code> but doesn't look much of a big deal.
We're left with <code>resize.py</code>. The differences in <em>on_key_pressed()</em> are because
I've probably used the keyboard instead the mouse (these are indeed manual installs).
The other difference is in how the partition labels are displayed. One of the installs
was probably using fresh disks while the other not.</p>

<p>As you can see the difference is minimal, mostly related to the underlying
hardware. As far as I can tell this has to do with how the bootloader is
installed on disk but I'm no expert on this particular piece of code.
I've seen the same difference in other comparisons so it probably has to do
more with hardware than with what kind of disk/driver is used.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell the difference is related to hardware clock settings,
probably due to different defaults in BIOS on the various hardware.
Additional tests with RAID 5 and RAID 6 reveals the same exact difference.
RAID 0 vs. RAID 10 shows no difference at all. Indeed as far as I know anaconda
delegates the creation of RAID arrays to mdadm once the desired configuration
is known so these results are to be expected.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see sometimes there are tests which appear to be very important
but in reality they cover a corner case of the base test. For example if any
of the RAID levels works we can be pretty confident 
<strike>all of them work</strike> <em>they won't break in anaconda</em>
(thanks Adam Williamson)!</p>
<p>What you do with this information is up to you. Sometimes QA is able to
execute all the tests and life is good. Sometimes we have to compromise,
skip some testing and accept the risks of doing so. Sometimes you can
execute all tests for every build, sometimes only once per milestone.
Whatever the case having the information to back up your decision is vital!</p>
<p>In my next post on this topic I'm going to talk more about functional tests
vs. unit tests. Both anaconda and blivet have both kinds of tests and I'm
interested to know if tests from the two categories focus on the same
functionality how are they different. If we have a unit test for feature X,
does it warrant to spend the resources doing functional testing for X as well?</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>My <a href="/blog/2015/10/14/anaconda-coverage.py-introduction/">previous post</a>
was an introduction to testing installation related components. Now I'm going to
talk more about anaconda and how it is tested.</p>
<p>There are two primary ways to test anaconda. You can execute <code>make check</code> in the
source directory which will trigger the package test suite. The other possibility
is to perform an actual installation, on bare meta or virtual machine, using the
<a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mash/">latest Rawhide snapshots</a> which also
include the latest anaconda. For both of these methods we can collect code
coverage information. In live installation mode coverage is enabled via the
<code>inst.debug</code> boot argument. Fedora 23 and earlier use <code>debug=1</code> but that
can lead to <a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/291">problems</a>
sometimes.</p>
<h2>Kickstart Testing</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/blob/master/docs/kickstart-docs.rst">Kickstart</a>
is a method of automating the installation of Fedora by supplying the necessary
configuration into a text file and pointing the installer at this file. There is
the directory <code>tests/kickstart_tests</code>, inside the anaconda source, where each
test is a kickstart file and a shell script. The test runner provisions a virtual
machine using boot.iso and the kickstart file. A shell script then verifies
installation was as expected and copies files of interest to the host system.
Kickstart files are also the basis for testing Fedora installations in
<a href="https://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/jobs/">Beaker</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally some of these in-package kickstart tests are the same as
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/fedoraqa/fedora-beaker-tests/">out-of-band kickstart tests</a>.
Hint: there are more available but not yet public.</p>
<p>The question which I don't have an answer for right now is
"Can we remove some of the duplicates and how this affects devel and QE teams" ?
The pros of in-package testing are that it is faster compared to Beaker. The cons
are that you're not testing the real distro (every snapshot is a possible final
release to the users).</p>
<h2>Dogtail</h2>
<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/">Dogtail</a> uses accessibility technologies to
communicate with desktop applications. It is written in Python and can be used
as GUI test automation framework. Long time ago I've proposed support for Dogtail
in anaconda which was rejected, then couple of years later it was accepted and
later removed from the code again.</p>
<p>Anaconda has in-package Dogtail tests (<code>tests/gui/</code>). They work by attaching
a second disk image with the test suite to a VM running a LiveCD. Anaconda is
started on the LiveCD and an attempt to install Fedora on disk 1 is made.
Everything is driven by the Dogtail scripts. There are only a few of these
tests available and they are currently disabled.
Red Hat QE has also created another method for running Dogtail tests in anaconda
using an updates.img with the previous functionality.</p>
<p>Even if there are some duplicate tests I'm not convinced we have to drop the
<code>tests/gui/</code> directory from the code because
the framework used to drive the graphical interface of anaconda appears to be very
well written. The code is clean and easy to follow.
Also I don't have metrics of how much these two methods differ or how much they cover
in their testing. IMO they are pretty close and before we can find a way to
reliably execute them on a regular basis there isn't much to be done here.
One idea is to use the <code>--dirinstall</code> or <code>--image</code> options and skip the
LiveCD part entirely.</p>
<h2>How Much is Tested</h2>
<p><code>make ci</code> covers 10% of the entire code base for anaconda. Mind you that
<code>tests/storage</code> and <code>tests/gui</code> are currently disabled.
See <a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/346">PR #346</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/327">PR #327</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/319">PR #319</a>!
There is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>On the other hand live installation testing is much
better. Text mode covers around 25% while graphical installations around 40%.
Text and graphical combined cover 50% though. These numbers will drop quite a bit
once anaconda learns to
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/397">include all possible files</a>
in its report but it is a good estimate.</p>
<p>The important questions to ask here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much can PyUnit tests cover in anaconda?</li>
<li>How much can kickstart tests cover ?</li>
<li>Have we reached a threshold in any of the two primary methods for testing ?</li>
<li>Does UI automation (with Dogtail) improve anything ?</li>
<li>When testing a particular feature (say user creation) how different is the
code execution path between manual (GUI) testing, kickstart and unit testing ?
If not so different can we invest in unit tests instead of higher level tests then ?</li>
<li>How different is the code execution path between different tests (manual or kickstart) ?
In other words how much value are we getting from testing for the resources we're putting in ?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post I will talk more about these questions and some rudimentary
analysis against coverage data from the various test methods and test cases!</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Since early 2015 I've been working on testing installation related
components in Rawhide. I'm interested in the code produced by the
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/">Red Hat Installer Engineering Team</a> and in
particular in <em>anaconda</em>, <em>blivet</em>, <em>pyparted</em> and <em>pykickstart</em>. The goal of
this effort is to improve the overall testing of these components and also
have Red Hat QE contribute some of our knowledge back to the community. The benefit
of course will be better software for everyone. In the next
several posts I'll summarize what has been done so far and what's to be expected
in the future.</p>
<h2>Test Documentation Matters</h2>
<p>Do you want others to contribute tests? I certainly do! When I started looking
at the code it was obviously clear there was no documentation related to testing.
Everyone needs to know how to write and execute these tests! Currently we have
basic README files describing how to install necessary dependencies for development
and test execution, how to execute the tests (and what can be tested) and most
importantly what is the test architecture. There is description of how the file
structure is organized and which are the base classes to inherit from when adding
new tests. Most of the times each component goes through a <em>pylint</em> check and
a standard PyUnit test suite.</p>
<p>Test documentation is usually in a <code>tests/README</code> file. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/master/tests/README.rst">anaconda</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/blivet/blob/master/tests/README.rst">blivet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/blob/master/tests/README.rst">pykickstart</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pyparted/blob/master/tests/README.rst">pyparted</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've tried to explain as much as possible without bloating the files and going into
unnecessary details. If you spot something missing please send a pull request.</p>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>This has been largely an effort driven by Chris Lumens from the devel team.
All the components I'm interested in are tested regularly in a CI environment.
There is a <code>make ci</code> Makefile target for those of you interested in what exactly
gets executed.</p>
<h2>Test Coverage</h2>
<p>In order to <strong>improve</strong> something you need to know where you stand. We'll I didn't.
That's why the first step was to integrate the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy">coverage.py</a> tool with all of these components.</p>
<p>With the exception of blivet (written in C) all of the other
components integrate well with coverage.py and produce good statistics. pykickstart is
the champ here with 90% coverage, while anaconda is somewhere between 10% and 50%.
Full test coverage measurement for anaconda isn't straight forward and will be the
subject of my next post. For the C based code we have to hook up with
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">Gcov</a> which shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
<p>At the moment there are several open pull requests to integrate the coverage test
targets with <code>make ci</code> and also report the results in human readable form. I will be
collecting these for historical references.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>I've created some basic text-mode
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/coverage-tools">coverage-tools</a> to help me combine and
compare data from different executions. These are only the start of it and I'm expanding
them as my needs for reporting and analytics evolve. I'm also looking into
<a href="/blog/2015/07/27/call-for-ideas-graphical-test-coverage-reports/">more detailed coverage reports</a>
but I don't have enough data and use cases to work on this front at the moment.</p>
<p>Some ideas currently in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>map code changes (git commits) to existing test coverage to get a feeling where to
invest in more testing;</li>
<li>map bugs to code areas and to existing test coverage to see if we aren't
missing tests in areas where the bugs are happening;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>coverage.py is a very nice tool indeed but I guess most people use it in a very
limited way. Shortly after I started working with it I've found several places which
need improvements. These have to do with combining and reporting on multiple files.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting issues I've found and still open are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-requests/63/">PR #63 - New option --dont-remove when combining coverage data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/425">#425 - source parameter not including files which are explicitly specified</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/426">#426 - Difference between coverage results with source specifies full dir instead of module name</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post I will talk about anaconda code coverage and what I want to do with it.
In the mean time please use the comments to share your feedback.</p>

adapter <a href="/blog/2015/05/04/thunderbolt-to-ethernet-adapter-on-linux/">working on Linux</a>
despite claims that it should not. Recently I've used my <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> to do a presentation
and the <a href="http://amzn.to/1Iqh0nd">Thunderbolt to VGA adapter</a> worked well enough.</p>
<p>It was an Acer adapter but I have no more details b/c it wasn't mine.</p>
<p>Before the event I've tested it and it worked so on the day of the event I've
freshly rebooted my laptop to be sure no crashed processes or anything like that
was running and gave it a go.</p>
<p>First time I plugged in the <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook</a> everything worked like a charm. Then my computer was
unplugged and the lid closed, causing it to suspend. The second time I've plugged it in
I was told there was nothing showing on the projector so I quickly plugged the adapter out
and then back in. It worked more or less.</p>
<p>At the time I had LibreOffice Impress in presentation
mode but I did see ABRT detecting a kernel problem. When my slides popped up the text
on the first one was mostly missing but the rest were ok!</p>
<p>Mind you I'm still running <a href="/blog/categories/mac/">RHEL 7 on my MacBook Air</a>. The above is
with kernel-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7.x86_64.</p>

on. Test stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test.</p>
<p>I've discovered an improperly written stub method in one of
<a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/">DNF</a>'s tests:</p>

<p>As seen here <em>stub_fn</em> replaces the <em>_get_query</em> methods from the class under
test. At the time of writing this has probably seemed like a good idea to
speed up writing the tests.</p>
<p>The trouble is we should be replacing the external dependencies of <em>_get_query</em>
(other parts of DNF essentially) and not methods from <em>DownloadCommand</em>. To
understand why this is a bad idea check
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/113">PR #113</a>,
which directly modifies <em>_get_query</em>. There's no way to test this patch
with the current state of the test.</p>
<p>So I took a few days to experiment and update the current test stubs. The
result is 
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/118">PR #118</a>.
The important bits are the <em>SackStub</em> and <em>SubjectStub</em> classes which hold
information about the available RPM packages on the system. The rest are cosmetics
to fit around the way the query objects are used (q.available(), q.latest(), q.filter()).
The proposed design correctly overrides the external dependencies on
<em>dnf.subject.Subject</em> and <em>self.base.sack</em> which are initialized before our
plugin is loaded by DNF.</p>
<p>I must say this is the first error of this kind I've seen in my QA practice so far.
I have no idea if this was a minor oversight or something which happens more frequently
in open source projects but it's a great example nevertheless.</p>

                    4000+ bugs in Fedora - checksec failures
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In the last week I've been trying to figure out how many packages
conform to the new
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Harden_All_Packages">Harden All Packages</a>
policy in Fedora!</p>
<p>From 46884 RPMs, 17385 are 'x86_64' meaning they may contain ELF objects.
From them 4489 are reported as failed <code>checksec</code>.</p>
<p>What you should see as the output from <code>checksec is</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    DSO             No RPATH   No RUNPATH
</pre></div>


<p>The first line is for binaries, the second one for libraries b/c
DSOs on x86_64 are always position-independent. Some RPATHs are acceptable,
e.g. <code>%{_libdir}/foo/</code> and I've tried to exclude them unless
other offenses are found. The script which does this is
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/checksec-collect">checksec-collect</a>.</p>
<p>Most often I'm seeing <em>Partial RELRO</em>, <em>No canary found</em> and <em>No PIE</em> errors.
Since all packages potentially process untrusted input, it makes sense for all of them
to be hardened and enhance the security of Fedora. That's why all of these errors
should be considered valid bugs.</p>
<h2>Attn package maintainers</h2>
<p>Please see if your package is in the list and try to fix it or let me know
why it should be excluded, for example it's a boot loader and doesn't function
properly with hardening enabled. The full list is available at
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/checksec.log">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>There's a typo in the Bulgarian translation of Messenger.com.
It is highlighted by the red dot on the picture.</p>
<p><em>hunspell</em> easily catches it so either Facebook doesn't run their
translations through a spell checker or their spell checker is
borked.</p>

                <p>Do you remember the 
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/pedometer-bug-in-samsung-gear-fit-smartwatch/">pedometer bug in Samsung Gear Fit</a>
I've discovered earlier ? It turns out that Samsung is a fan of this one
and has the exact same bug in their <em>S Health</em> application.</p>
<p>The application doesn't block pedometer(e.g. steps counting) while
performing other activities such as cycling for example. So in reallity it
reports incorrect value for burned callories. At this time I call it
bad software development practice/architecture on Samsung's part which leads
to this bug being present.</p>

                <p>When editing the grub2 menu (especially in EFI mode) it tells you to
press Ctrl-x to save your changes and continue the boot process.
However this doesn't work on my <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a>, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1253637">rhbz#1253637</a>,
and maybe some other platforms. If this is the case try pressing <strong>F10</strong> 
instead. It works for me!</p>

                    Call for Ideas: Graphical Test Coverage Reports
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>
<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>
<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>
<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format, 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a 
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>
<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>
<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>
<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

                    DEVit Conf 2015 Impressions
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>It's been a busy week after <a href="http://devitconf.org/">DEVit conf</a> took place in
Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.</p>
<p><img alt="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" src="/images/devit2015.jpg" title="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" /></p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>I've started the day with the session called "Crack, Train, Fix, Release" by 
Chris Heilmann. While it was very interesting for some unknown reason I
was expecting a talk more closely related to software testing. Unfortunately at the
same time in the other room was a talk called "Integration Testing from the Trenches"
by Nicolas Frankel which I missed.</p>
<p>At the end Chris answered the question "What to do about old versions of IE ?".
And the answer pretty much was "Don't try to support everything, leave them with
basic functionality so that users can achieve what they came for on your website.
Don't put nice buttons b/c IE 6 users are not used to nice things and they get confused."</p>
<p>If you remember I had a similar question to Jeremy Keith at 
<a href="/blog/2015/04/20/videos-from-bulgaria-web-summit-2015/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a> last month
and the answer was similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Which one is Jeremy's favorite device/browser to develop for.</p>
<p>A: Your approach is wrong and instead we should be thinking in terms of what features are 
essential or non-essential for our websites and develop around features
(if supported, if not supported) not around browsers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Btw I did ask Chris if he knows Jeremy and he does.</p>
<p>After the coffee break there was "JavaScript ♥ Unicode" by Mathias Bynens which
I saw last year at <a href="http://how.camp/">How Camp</a> in Veliko Tarnovo so I just stopped by
to say hi and went to listen to 
"The future of responsive web design: web component queries" by Nikos Zinas.
As far as I understood Nikos is a local rock-star developer. I'm not much into web
development but the opportunity to create your own HTML components (tags) looks
very promising. I guess there will be more business coming for
<a href="http://telerik.com">Telerik</a> :).</p>
<p>I wanted to listen to "Live Productive Coder" by Heinz Kabutz but that one started
in Greek so I switched the room for 
"iOS real time content modifications using websockets" by  Benny Weingarten-Gabbay.</p>
<p>After lunch I went straight for
"Introduction to Docker: What is it and why should I care?" by Ian Miell
which IMO was the most interesting talk of the day. It wasn't very technical but
managed to clear some of the mysticism around Docker and what it actually is.
I tried to grab a few minutes of Ian's time and we found topics of common interest
to talk about (<a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/">Project Atomic</a> anyone?) but later
failed to find him and continue the talk. I guess I'll have to follow online.</p>
<p>Tim Perry with "Your Web Stack Would Betray You In An Instant" made a great show.
The room was packed, I myself was actually standing the whole time. He described a series
of failures across the entire web development stack which gave developers hard times
patching and upgrading their services. The lesson: everything fails, be prepared!</p>
<p>The last talk I visited was "GitHub Automation" by Forbes Lindesay. It was more of an
inspirational talk, rather than technical one. GitHub provides cool API so why not use it?</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><img alt="DEVit team" src="/images/devit2015team.jpg" title="DEVit team" /></p>
<p>From what I know this is the first year of DEVit. For a first timer the team did great!
I particularly liked the two coffee breaks before lunch and in the early afternoon and the
sponsors pitches in between the main talks.</p>
<p>All talks were recorded but I have no idea what's happening with the videos!</p>
<p>I will definitely make a point of visiting Thessaloniki more often and follow the local
IT and start-up scenes there. And tonight is Silicon Drinkabout which will be the official
after party of <a href="http://digitalk.bg/">DigitalK</a> in Sofia.</p>

                    Why does sysctl not write under /sys
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I've been looking into 
<a href="/blog/2015/04/30/fixing-tilde-and-function-keys-mapping-for-macbook-air-on-linux/">fixing tilde and Fn keys mapping for MacBook Air</a>
and thought I could use <code>sysctl</code> to permanently set the desired values. Unfortunately this is not
possible. <code>sysctl</code> can only write under <code>/proc/sys</code> and this is 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/blob/master/sysctl.c#L54">hard-coded in the source</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>static const char PROC_PATH[] = &quot;/proc/sys/&quot;;
</pre></div>


<p>IMO this is relatively easy to patch and allow sysctl to read/write values under /sys.
The only open question I see is backward compatibility - maybe adding new parameter (e.g. --sysfs)
or adding extended sytax e.g. if variable name starts with / then treat it as absolute path.</p>
<p>I've asked sysctl maintainers on the 
<a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Can-we-make-sysctl-readwrite-sys-values-along-with-procsys">procps mailing list</a>
but so far got no answer. </p>
<p>Is anyone else interested in this? How do you set parameter values under /sys then ?</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> for my particular purposes I could have used config files under
<em>/etc/modprobe.d/</em> or a startup script (I used that) instead.</p>

            </a>
                <p>A quick solution for <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> users running Linux who want to
use external projector is to use a USB to VGA adapter. Mine is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AIJE9G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004AIJE9G&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=74W7KWXBGC7SZ5QH">Plugable UGA-165</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004AIJE9G" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and it works great with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1.</p>
<p>After the device is plugged in the <em>udl</em> kernel module is loaded
and a new framebuffer device is created (/dev/fb1 in my case). Using
<em>mate-display-properties</em> I'm able to configure the 2nd monitor attached
to the USB video card. I was able to succeffully display an OpenOffice
presentation on the 2nd monitor and play YouTube video.</p>
<p>All USB 2.0 devices from Plugable should be well supported on Linux.
For USB 3.0 David Airlie from Red Hat is doing some reverse engineering
but I have no idea what the status is. For more info see:</p>
