                    Call for Ideas: Graphical Test Coverage Reports
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>
<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>
<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>
<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format, 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a 
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>
<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>
<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>
<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

                    DEVit Conf 2015 Impressions
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>It's been a busy week after <a href="http://devitconf.org/">DEVit conf</a> took place in
Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.</p>
<p><img alt="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" src="/images/devit2015.jpg" title="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" /></p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>I've started the day with the session called "Crack, Train, Fix, Release" by 
Chris Heilmann. While it was very interesting for some unknown reason I
was expecting a talk more closely related to software testing. Unfortunately at the
same time in the other room was a talk called "Integration Testing from the Trenches"
by Nicolas Frankel which I missed.</p>
<p>At the end Chris answered the question "What to do about old versions of IE ?".
And the answer pretty much was "Don't try to support everything, leave them with
basic functionality so that users can achieve what they came for on your website.
Don't put nice buttons b/c IE 6 users are not used to nice things and they get confused."</p>
<p>If you remember I had a similar question to Jeremy Keith at 
<a href="/blog/2015/04/20/videos-from-bulgaria-web-summit-2015/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a> last month
and the answer was similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Which one is Jeremy's favorite device/browser to develop for.</p>
<p>A: Your approach is wrong and instead we should be thinking in terms of what features are 
essential or non-essential for our websites and develop around features
(if supported, if not supported) not around browsers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Btw I did ask Chris if he knows Jeremy and he does.</p>
<p>After the coffee break there was "JavaScript ♥ Unicode" by Mathias Bynens which
I saw last year at <a href="http://how.camp/">How Camp</a> in Veliko Tarnovo so I just stopped by
to say hi and went to listen to 
"The future of responsive web design: web component queries" by Nikos Zinas.
As far as I understood Nikos is a local rock-star developer. I'm not much into web
development but the opportunity to create your own HTML components (tags) looks
very promising. I guess there will be more business coming for
<a href="http://telerik.com">Telerik</a> :).</p>
<p>I wanted to listen to "Live Productive Coder" by Heinz Kabutz but that one started
in Greek so I switched the room for 
"iOS real time content modifications using websockets" by  Benny Weingarten-Gabbay.</p>
<p>After lunch I went straight for
"Introduction to Docker: What is it and why should I care?" by Ian Miell
which IMO was the most interesting talk of the day. It wasn't very technical but
managed to clear some of the mysticism around Docker and what it actually is.
I tried to grab a few minutes of Ian's time and we found topics of common interest
to talk about (<a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/">Project Atomic</a> anyone?) but later
failed to find him and continue the talk. I guess I'll have to follow online.</p>
<p>Tim Perry with "Your Web Stack Would Betray You In An Instant" made a great show.
The room was packed, I myself was actually standing the whole time. He described a series
of failures across the entire web development stack which gave developers hard times
patching and upgrading their services. The lesson: everything fails, be prepared!</p>
<p>The last talk I visited was "GitHub Automation" by Forbes Lindesay. It was more of an
inspirational talk, rather than technical one. GitHub provides cool API so why not use it?</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><img alt="DEVit team" src="/images/devit2015team.jpg" title="DEVit team" /></p>
<p>From what I know this is the first year of DEVit. For a first timer the team did great!
I particularly liked the two coffee breaks before lunch and in the early afternoon and the
sponsors pitches in between the main talks.</p>
<p>All talks were recorded but I have no idea what's happening with the videos!</p>
<p>I will definitely make a point of visiting Thessaloniki more often and follow the local
IT and start-up scenes there. And tonight is Silicon Drinkabout which will be the official
after party of <a href="http://digitalk.bg/">DigitalK</a> in Sofia.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    Why does sysctl not write under /sys
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I've been looking into 
<a href="/blog/2015/04/30/fixing-tilde-and-function-keys-mapping-for-macbook-air-on-linux/">fixing tilde and Fn keys mapping for MacBook Air</a>
and thought I could use <code>sysctl</code> to permanently set the desired values. Unfortunately this is not
possible. <code>sysctl</code> can only write under <code>/proc/sys</code> and this is 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps/blob/master/sysctl.c#L54">hard-coded in the source</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>static const char PROC_PATH[] = &quot;/proc/sys/&quot;;
</pre></div>


<p>IMO this is relatively easy to patch and allow sysctl to read/write values under /sys.
The only open question I see is backward compatibility - maybe adding new parameter (e.g. --sysfs)
or adding extended sytax e.g. if variable name starts with / then treat it as absolute path.</p>
<p>I've asked sysctl maintainers on the 
<a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/procps/Can-we-make-sysctl-readwrite-sys-values-along-with-procsys">procps mailing list</a>
but so far got no answer. </p>
<p>Is anyone else interested in this? How do you set parameter values under /sys then ?</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> for my particular purposes I could have used config files under
<em>/etc/modprobe.d/</em> or a startup script (I used that) instead.</p>

            </a>
                <p>A quick solution for <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> users running Linux who want to
use external projector is to use a USB to VGA adapter. Mine is

and it works great with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1.</p>
<p>After the device is plugged in the <em>udl</em> kernel module is loaded
and a new framebuffer device is created (/dev/fb1 in my case). Using
<em>mate-display-properties</em> I'm able to configure the 2nd monitor attached
to the USB video card. I was able to succeffully display an OpenOffice
presentation on the 2nd monitor and play YouTube video.</p>
<p>All USB 2.0 devices from Plugable should be well supported on Linux.
For USB 3.0 David Airlie from Red Hat is doing some reverse engineering
but I have no idea what the status is. For more info see:</p>

<p>Unplugging and pluggin back in the network cable works as expected.
I did see my computer freeze 2 out of 10 times when I've unplugged the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1Iqi22v">Thunderbolt adapter</a> but couldn't reproduce it repliably
or grab more info. </p>
<p>For the record this is with kernel 3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64 which is missing
this
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git/commit/?h=char-misc-next&amp;id=16603153666d22df544ae9f9b3764fd18da28eeb">upstream commit</a>.
I'm not sure why it works though.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly <em>tg3</em> is available during installation so you should
be able to use the <a href="http://amzn.to/1Iqi22v">Thunderbolt adapter</a> instead of WiFi as well.</p>

                <p>One of the best SIP clients for Linux is <a href="http://twinklephone.com/">Twinkle</a>.
However upstream is not active (or even maybe dead) and the package is missing from
latest Fedora releases and fails to build on RHEL 7.</p>
<p>First you need to build and install a few dependencies in the following order:
<a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8437">ucommon</a>,
<a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=1443">ccrtp</a>,
<a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6408">libzrtpcpp</a>.
You will also need <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL 7</a> enabled
to satisfy build dependencies.</p>
<p>Then apply the following patch to the original 
<a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=397914">twinkle.spec</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">---</span> <span class="n">twinkle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">spec</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">orig</span>   <span class="mi">2015</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mo">05</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mo">01</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">07</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mf">01.870710147</span> <span class="o">+</span><span class="mo">0300</span>

<p>The package now builds, installs and runs successfully on RHEL 7.

                <p>Thera are two problems with the <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> keyboard on Linux:</p>
<p>Function keys and media keys are switched and by default you have to

<a href="https://chaidarun.com/fedora-mbp">solution</a> is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>echo 2 &gt; /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode

<p>The tilde key is mapped improperly, see 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1025041#c2">RHBZ #1025041</a>.
To fix it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>echo 0 &gt; /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout

<h2>Permanent fix</h2>
<p>Either you have to add the above commands in a boot script or you can
<code>yum install mba-kbd-fix</code> from my
<a href="/blog/2015/04/29/rhel-7-repository-for-macbook-air/">Macbook Air RHEL 7 repository</a>.

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>One issue with RHEL/CentOS/Fedora on <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> laptops is brightness control
and backlight behavior after suspend/resume. I've found the solution 
<a href="http://mattoncloud.org/2014/02/05/fedora-20-on-a-macbook-air/">here</a>
and only tweaked it slightly for my use case.</p>
<h2>mba6x_bl doesn't load automatically</h2>
<p>The reason being the driver matches older hardware:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>modinfo mba6x_bl
filename:       /lib/modules/3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64/extra/mba6x_bl/mba6x_bl.ko
<span class="nb">alias</span>:          dmi:*:pnMacBookAir6*
license:        GPL
description:    MacBook Air 6,1 and 6,2 backlight driver
author:         Patrik Jakobsson &lt;patrik.r.jakobsson@gmail.com&gt;
rhelversion:    7.1
srcversion:     4D069C8EB0E470AF27E7F8D
depends:        video
vermagic:       3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64 SMP mod_unload modversions
</pre></div>


<p>My system is <strong>MacBookAir7,2</strong> and doesn't match the module alias. So a 
<a href="https://github.com/patjak/mba6x_bl/pull/25">quick fix</a> was needed.
For more info about <code>MODULE_ALIAS</code> see
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modalias">ArchWiki</a>.
Alternatively on Red Hat based systems you can place a config file
under <code>/etc/sysconfig/modules</code>, see 
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Persistent_Module_Loading.html">the docs</a>
for more details.</p>
<h2>intel_backlight driver is in the way</h2>
<p>On older systems mba6x_bl doesn't get used automatically. The problem is the offending
intel_backlight driver which gets used instead. To workaround it add this xorg.conf snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/98-mba_bl.conf
Section <span class="s2">&quot;Device&quot;</span>
    Identifier      <span class="s2">&quot;Intel Graphics&quot;</span>
    Driver          <span class="s2">&quot;intel&quot;</span>
    Option          <span class="s2">&quot;Backlight&quot;</span>     <span class="s2">&quot;mba6x_backlight&quot;</span>
EndSection
</pre></div>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>There is an easy way to disable the <a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook</a> startup sound
(boot chime) even after wiping out OS X and installing Linux.</p>
<p>This sound can be easily disabled if you mute the volume in OS X
and shutdown the computer. The value is stored in NVRAM.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot the computer and hold Cmd+Alt(Option)+R. This will start
OS X Internet recovery mode;</li>
<li>
<p>Open the terminal and issue the following command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Voila. In Linux try this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># efivar -l | grep SystemAudioVolume
 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolume
 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolumeDB

</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Before disabling both variables had non zero values. Also <em>SystemAudioVolumeDB</em>
doesn't seem to have any effect.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> RHEL or CentOS users need to rebuild <em>efivar</em> from the 
<a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/efivar/0.14/1.fc22/src/efivar-0.14-1.fc22.src.rpm">Fedora src.rpm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note 3:</strong> several Internet sources suggest that writing EFI variables from Linux
may sometimes corrupt your Apple firmware. I didn't research this any further. If you
happen to figure out how to successfully write to these variables under Linux please let
everyone know in the comments (in case OS X recovery mode goes missing, you know).</p>

            </a>
                <p>After I got my 
<a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> <a href="/blog/2015/04/26/installing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-on-macbook-air-2015/">installed with RHEL 7.1</a>
the first priority was getting wireless working. 
First check if your device isn't already supported
<a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43/#Supported_devices">upstream</a>. Mine isn't</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">14</span><span class="n">e4</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">43</span><span class="n">a0</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Broadcom</span> <span class="n">Corporation</span> <span class="n">BCM4360</span> <span class="mf">802.11</span><span class="n">ac</span> <span class="n">Wireless</span> <span class="n">Network</span> <span class="n">Adapter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">rev</span> <span class="mi">03</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next grab the src.rpm files necessary to build the <em>wl</em> driver from RPM Fusion.
For <code>akmods-0.5.2-1.fc21.src.rpm</code>, <code>broadcom-wl-6.30.223.248-2.fc21.src.rpm</code>,
<code>kmodtool-1-23.fc20.src.rpm</code> just execute <em>rpmbuild --rebuild</em> against each file
and install <code>kmodtool</code> and <code>akmods</code>.</p>
<p>Then you need two more files <code>buildsys-build-rpmfusion</code> and <code>wl-kmod</code>.
The first one is a helper tool containing list of recent kernels to build against,
the later one is the driver source itself. Both needed minor modifications before
building on RHEL 7.</p>
<p>I've created my own 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/buildsys-build-rpmfusion-for-rhel7">buildsys-build-rpmfusion</a> package listing the current kernels
for RHEL 7.1. For <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/wl-kmod-for-rhel7">wl-kmod</a> I've introduced a 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/wl-kmod-for-rhel7/blob/master/wl-kmod-100_redhat.patch">patch</a>
which modifies the other patches in the package so it builds correctly on 7.1.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't know if there's a define which can be used to detect if we're building
on RHEL (maybe I can define my own) but direct kernel version number comparison doesn't
work here because Red Hat backports chosen functionality from more recent kernels without
changing the version number. This approach may not be the best one but I've tried to keep it clean
for easier maintenance in the future and it got me started very quickly.</p>
<p>Build the modified buildsys-build-rpmfusion and:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>yum install buildsys-build-rpmfusion-7-1.x86_64.rpm buildsys-build-rpmfusion-kerneldevpkgs-current-7-1.x86_64.rpm
</pre></div>


<p>Build the wl-kmod package and:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>yum install akmod-wl-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm broadcom-wl-6.30.223.248-2.el7.noarch.rpm kmod-wl-3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm kmod-wl-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm
</pre></div>


<p>If necessary re-create your initramfs image to include <em>wl.ko</em>.</p>

                    Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on MacBook Air 2015
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I've upgraded to a new 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UGECEUY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00UGECEUY&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=3YENGI5TIYKEC5GM">MacBook Air</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UGECEUY" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
(13 inch, early 2015) laptop and luckily enough I'm running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 on it. Here is how to install it.</p>
<h2>Prepare boot media</h2>
<p>The easiest method is to boot from a USB stick which holds
either the entire DVD or just boot.iso. Since I happened to find a 1GB only USB stick I
went for the boot.iso. <code>dd if=boot.iso of=/dev/sdb</code> is the only thing you need to prepare
the boot media.</p>
<h2>Initial boot</h2>
<p><img alt="Mac boot menu" src="/images/mac/boot_menu.jpg" title="Mac boot menu" /></p>
<p>While computer is booting hold the (left) Alt (Option) key to enter <em>Startup Manager</em>.
Wait a second or two before it displays your local hard drive and the USB boot media.
Select the option <em>EFI boot</em> to boot the anaconda installer.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Booting from a boot.iso means I need to use the network to grab the rest of the installation.
Because the wireless card needs proprietary drivers
I've tried both USB to Ethernet adapter and USB tethering with my phone.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> initially I have forgotten to plug in my USB networking card which resulted in 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1191286">bug #1191286</a>. After cold-plugging and
rebooting the system everything was fine. Subsequently I don't see any problems with the
USB networking card. The bug should be fixed in RHEL 7.2 btw.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've been using a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PONXAI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002PONXAI&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=N4KGQKYSBSDWMMM6">USB docking station from Plugable</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002PONXAI" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
for years because their products are Linux friendly. In particular the networking chip is ASIX and
there is no problems with drivers for Linux.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-05-04:</strong>
You should also be able to use a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter which is more
common for Apple users. <a href="/blog/2015/05/04/thunderbolt-to-ethernet-adapter-on-linux/">See here for more info</a>;</p>
<p>In my case I've wiped out the entire SSD disk b/c I don't care about dual boot.
Previously I've heard about anaconda crashing while it tries to detect the Mac OS file system.
I've played around with Rawhide before going for RHEL 7.1 and didn't see any problems related to
foreign filesystems.</p>
<p>I've gone with the default partitioning scheme while slightly modifing the partition sizes, etc.</p>
<h2>Post install</h2>
<p>There are several issues which still need attention. I didn't have enough time in the last few
days to check these out:</p>
<p><strong>Things which work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 sucks big time. Fortunately I was able to install MATE Desktop from EPEL;</li>
<li>Wireless card needs drivers; I've managed to compile them myself, 
<a href="/blog/2015/04/27/compiling-broadcom-wl-kmod-wifi-driver-for-rhel-7/">see here</a>;</li>
<li>Display brightness doesn't seem to work at all. On top of that the display goes full black
after suspend-resume. I could barely see anything on it. 
<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2015/04/29/fixing-display-brightness-on-macbook-air-with-rhel-7/">Fixed here</a>!</li>
<li>There is a very annoying boot chime <strike>which I have no idea how to disable</strike>
<a href="/blog/2015/04/27/disabling-macbook-startup-sound-in-linux/">Fixed here</a>;</li>
<li>The onboard keyboard is quite annoying for previous ThinkPad user like myself. Most
importantly I need to press Fn to activate the F1, F2, etc keys which I use a lot in mcedit.
<a href="/blog/2015/04/30/fixing-tilde-and-function-keys-mapping-for-macbook-air-on-linux/">Fixed here</a>;</li>
<li>Output sound works - both speakers and headphones;</li>
<li>Microphone works (tested with a hands free device);</li>
<li>Power manager was reporting my battery life totally wrong but after a full discharge/recharge
it seems to have calibrated itself;</li>
<li>ATrpms and EPEL are still missing some codecs for RHEL 7 which means no movies;
 codecs seem to work now with the <a href="http://li.nux.ro/repos.html">NUX Desktop</a>
repos. Not sure what I was missing when testing it initially;</li>
<li><em>UPDATE 2015-05-04:</em> I do have a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter and hot-plug seems to work
despite claims that this is not supported in Linux.
<a href="/blog/2015/05/04/thunderbolt-to-ethernet-adapter-on-linux/">See here for more info</a>;</li>
<li><em>UPDATE 2015-05-05:</em> Presenting via external projector works with a USB to VGA adapter.
<a href="/blog/2015/05/05/using-usb-to-vga-adapter-on-macbook-air-with-linux/">See here</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things that don't work yet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>UPDATE 2015-04-30:</em> I'd like to remap the Cmd key to the Menu key found in PC keyboards;</li>
<li>Camera doesn't work, reverse engineering a <a href="https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie">driver</a>
 is in progress;</li>
<li>I'm missing the <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkLight">ThinkLight</a> from my X220,
however the integrated Broadcom FaceTime HD camera doesn't seem to have a LED flash
which can be repurposed for this task;</li>
<li>I need a CPU temperature monitor and maybe CPU fan speed needs adjustments;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-04-28:</strong>
Check the list above for links to wifi and backlight drivers and how to disable the boot chime.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-04-29:</strong>
You can find precompiled RPMS in my
<a href="/blog/2015/04/29/rhel-7-repository-for-macbook-air/">Macbook Air RHEL 7 repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-04-30:</strong>
Added more links and split the list into stuff which already works and stuff that doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-05-04:</strong>
Added info about Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-05-05:</strong>
Added info about USB to VGA adapter.</p>
<h2>Fedora 22 on MacBook Air</h2>
<p>I did try Fedora 22 Beta and experienced 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215458">bug #1215458</a>.
Also for some reason the installation hit an error downloading a package and didn't let me retry
but forced me to exit the process.</p>
<p>I'll continue posting my updates until the system runs smoothly like it is supposed to.</p>

<p><a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com">Bulgaria Web Summit</a> 2015 is over. The event was
incredible and I had a lot of fun moderating the main room. We had many people
coming from other countries and I've made lots of new friends.
Thank you to everyone who attended!</p>

                    How to Find if LVM Volume is Thinly Provisioned
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>The latest versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora all
support LVM thin provisioning. Here's how to tell if a logical volume
has been thinly provisioned or not.</p>
<p>Using <code>lvs</code> to display volume information look under the <em>Attr</em> column.
Attribute values have the following meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lv_attr bits are:</p>
<p>1  Volume type: (C)ache, (m)irrored, (M)irrored without initial sync, (o)rigin,
(O)rigin  with  merging  snapshot, (r)aid,  (R)aid  without  initial  sync,
(s)napshot,  merging  (S)napshot, (p)vmove, (v)irtual, mirror or raid (i)mage,
mirror or raid (I)mage out-of-sync, mirror (l)og device, under  (c)onversion,
thin  (V)olume,  (t)hin pool, (T)hin pool data, raid or pool m(e)tadata or
pool metadata spare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how <code>lvs</code> looks like when you have a regular LVM setup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># lvs
  LV   VG              Attr       LSize  Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  root rhel_dhcp70-183 -wi-ao---- 17,47g                                                    
  swap rhel_dhcp70-183 -wi-ao----  2,00g
</pre></div>


<p>When using LVM thin provisioning you're looking for the left-most attribute bit
to be V, t or T. Here's an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># lvs
  LV     VG              Attr       LSize  Pool   Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  pool00 rhel_dhcp71-101 twi-aotz-- 14,55g               7,52   3,86                            
  root   rhel_dhcp71-101 Vwi-aotz-- 14,54g pool00        7,53                                   
  swap   rhel_dhcp71-101 -wi-ao----  2,00g

                    Tip: Linux-IO default LUN is 0 instead of 1
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I've been testing iBFT in KVM which worked quite well with a RHEL 6 iSCSI target
and failed miserably when I switched to RHEL 7 iSCSI target.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>iPXE&gt; dhcp net0
DHCP (net0 52:54:00:12:34:56)... ok
iPXE&gt; set keep-san 1
iPXE&gt; sanboot iscsi:10.0.0.1:::1:iqn.2015-05.com.example:target1
Could not open SAN device: Input/output error (http://ipxe.org/1d704539)
iPXE&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>The <a href="http://ipxe.org/err/1d7045">error page</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the default configuration when Linux is the target is for the disk to be LUN 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well this is not true for Linux-IO (targetcli). <strong>The default LUN is 0!</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>iPXE&gt; sanboot iscsi:10.0.0.1:::0:iqn.2015-05.com.example:target1
Registered SAN device 0x80
Booting from SAN device 0x80
</pre></div>


<p>Kudos to Bruno Goncalves from Red Hat in helping me debug this issue!</p>

                    How to Configure targetcli to Listen on IPv4 and IPv6
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In order to configure <em>targetcli</em> to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 one has to
delete the default IPv4 portal configuration and replace it with IPv6 instead.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># targetcli 
/&gt;
/&gt; cd iscsi/iqn.2015-04.com.example:target1/tpg1/portals
/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; ls
o- portals ............................................................................................................ [Portals: 1]
  o- 0.0.0.0:3260 ............................................................................................................. [OK]
/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; delete 0.0.0.0 3260
Deleted network portal 0.0.0.0:3260
/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; create ::0
Using default IP port 3260
Created network portal ::0:3260.
/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; ls
o- portals ............................................................................................................ [Portals: 1]
  o- [::0]:3260 ............................................................................................................... [OK]
/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; exit

# netstat -antp | grep 3260
tcp6       0      0 :::3260                 :::*                    LISTEN
</pre></div>


<p>It appears the target is listening only on IPv6 but in fact it will
also accept connections over IPv4. I've tried it. </p>
<p>This is a bit counter intuitive, however if you try adding the IPv6 address
without removing the default IPv4 one <em>targetcli</em> will throw an error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/iscsi/iqn.20.../tpg1/portals&gt; create ::0
Using default IP port 3260
Could not create NetworkPortal in configFS.
/&gt;
</pre></div>
