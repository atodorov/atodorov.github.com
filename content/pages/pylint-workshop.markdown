Pylint is the most popular Python source code analyzer which looks for
programming errors, helps enforce a coding standard and detects some
code smells. It is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.


Objectives
----------

* To understand how a pylint plugin works
* To get some hands-on experience with writing plugins
* To be able to write a non-complex plugin by the end of the workshop


Agenda
------

* Introduction to how pylint works
* Implementing a plugin skeleton - hands-on exercise
* Invoking the plugin - hands-on exercise
* Parsing Abstract Syntax Trees in the Python shell – hands-on exercise
* Putting together a minimalistic plugin - hands-on exercise

* Formulating (your) ideas into actionable goals
* Writing code and code review - hands-on exercise
* Testing your plugin


Target audience
---------------

Developers who work with Python (and/or Django) and are fans of static analytic tools
and/or QA engineers who work with the project source code directly! In order to get
the maximum of this workshop you need to have moderate skills in programming with Python!


Technical requirements
----------------------

* Python 3.6 installed and running
* Text editor or IDE of your choice – you must know how to use them !
* virtualenv (virtualenv-wrapper) tools installed and running so you can
  configure a working environment for your pylint plugins
* pylint >= 1.8 installed inside the virtualenv

Try to identify code patterns which are not detected by standard pylint checks
so that you can write a plugin for them. Practice patters will be provided by
trainer.

Try to keep the simplest checks at the top of your list and the more complex
ones at the bottom.
