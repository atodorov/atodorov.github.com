Back in February 2013 Russell Beattie has published an article on his blog
titled
[Artisanal Websites: The rise of .io domains for well crafted web services](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services)
. He has compiled a great deal of sites in the .io domain space with screenshots
and links to each individual service. There are lots of interesting ones, so 
go and check them out!

I'm glad Russell has added [Difio](http://www.dif.io) as well!
