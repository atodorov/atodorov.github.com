Does this look familiar to you ? 

!["HackFMI UI bug"](/images/hackfmi_facebook_bug.png "HackFMI UI bug")

No? See 
[SofiaValley](/blog/2013/06/02/sofiavalley-ui-bug/) and 
[opensource.com](/blog/2013/07/31/ui-bug-for-opensource-dot-com/).

Either this is a very common front-end mistake (I would blame CSS) or
Facebook have screwed up their buttons.
