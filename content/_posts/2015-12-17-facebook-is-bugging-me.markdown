![Facebook icon](/images/facebook_android_icon_small.png "Facebook icon")

Facebook for Android version 55.0.0.18.66 broke the home screen icon title.
It reads `false` instead of `Facebook`. This is now fixed in version 58.0.0.28.70.
I wonder how they managed to get this slip through. Also isn't Google
supposed to review the apps coming into the Play Store and not publish them
if there are such visible issues ? I guess this wasn't the case here.
