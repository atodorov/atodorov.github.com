Yesterday I've
[mentioned](/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding/)
a start-up project called
[obuvki41plus.com](http://obuvki41plus.com) and that it accepts phone orders
instead of online electronic orders like everyone else. I will tell you why.

[obuvki41plus.com](http://obuvki41plus.com/) is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus, which are hard to find in Bulgaria.
There is a shopping cart component on the website which at the end redirects to
a simple page with instructions how to order via phone. Why not online
orders like everyone else? Several reasons!

The business target group is very limited - women who wear large shoe size
and like the proposed shoe style and can afford the higher price (quality shoes
only, sorry). On top of
that the business model is **online only**. The rule of thumb is to **make
everything possible to lower barrier to entry for customers**!
Also don't make our lives harder in doing so.

* Phone ordering is the easiest way for customers in Bulgaria.
I myself often prefer it because of the too many steps and too many fields
to fill-in when ordering online. The reality is that most local websites
are horribly made with respect to user experience and many users are not
that fluent with Internet as it may seem. No need to get people frustrated
if they are about to spend their money with you!

* Phone ordering, especially in the early business stage lets you know
your customers. This is invaluable feedback for you as the owner and you
can't get that from an online ordering system. It just doesn't work,
I've tried!

* A phone ordering system is just so easy to implement. Later that can
be scaled with some automated IVR system and a call center; Or just
migrate it to online ordering system;

* The website in question is supposed to be no-maintenance as much
as possible. It is static HTML and no database at all. Introducing
online ordering is just too much of a technological overhead in this case;

* Last but probably most important is customer care - not only we want to
make it easy for them to order but want to prevent frequent returns
caused by wrong product expectations or incorrect size. After all shoes
need to be tried first.

So to summarize - the orders are taken in person via phone
including objection handling and questions answering. An order may consist
of up to 3 pairs of shoes which are shipped to the customer with the option
to try them out upon delivery! Buy all or just a pair - it's a customer call!
Small return fee is imposed to prevent abuse!


For that kind of business this seems to be the best solution so far.
I'd love to hear other owners experience and decision logic. Please use
the comments to tell us how you've organized the sales/ordering/delivery
process in your company and why so. Thanks!
