Sorry for not being able to write anything this month. I've been very sick
and hardly even touched a computer in the last few weeks. I promise to make
it up to you next month. Until then here's the books I've managed to read in
January.


Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products
-------------------------------------------

[Hooked](http://amzn.to/1erRrnb) is an ebook for Kindle which I luckily got for
free on NYE (it's paid now). The book describes the so called "Hook Model"
which is a guide to building products people canâ€™t put down. 

The book goes through a cycle of **trigger**, **action**, **variable reward** and
**investment** to describe how one can design a product which users keep using
without you doing anything (pretty much). There are plenty of examples with products
like Instagram and Pinterest.

I really find the book interesting and will strongly recommend it as a must read
to anyone who is building a product. If you're thinking about a mobile app or an
online service this book is definitely for you.


CyberJoly Drim
---------------

[CyberJoly Drim](http://hell.pl/nina/carramba.htm) is a 1998 cyber punk story by
Polish writer Antonina Liedtke. One I've heard about through the years but found
just recently. It's about a love story although everything else is fiction. PDF format
is around 30 pages.

I found it hard to read especially b/c my Polish is totally rusty (not to mention I hardly
understand it) and Google translate didn't manage well neither. Anyway, not a bad read
before bed time if you like this kind of stuff.


The First in Bulgarian Internet
--------------------------------

Last a book about 
[Bulgarian Internet pioneers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13398350). The book
compiles a great deal with historical data as well as interviews and web site descriptions.
It's said to mention about 400 persons. 

The events start around 1989 with the BBS systems at the time and the first one to appear in
the country with accounts of first time logging into the network and pretty much seeing a
computer. Then it goes to tell the story of first companies and Internet providers, how they
started business, how they grew and formed the country's backbone infrastructure. There's
lots of personal memories and stories as well. This goes to about 2002 when the book
was written.


The second part of the book mostly describes various websites, some of the first ones and
some milestone or famous ones. It's organized by date of website launch but isn't that much
interesting. I find the local contents at the time a bit boring.


The book isn't what I initially expected - I wanted more personal stories and more news from
the kitchen. It's not that, it looks to me the people who were interviewed had chosen their
words very carefully and didn't reveal any sensational stories.

The nice thing about all of that is I've started using the web in early 1998 and remember
most of the events and websites described in the book. It's good to remember the history.
I own the book and can give it to you if you like. It's on the [Give Away](/blog/2013/04/05/give-away-list/)
list.



I hope you find something interesting to read in my library. If not please share what did you
read this month.

you there if you're coming.
