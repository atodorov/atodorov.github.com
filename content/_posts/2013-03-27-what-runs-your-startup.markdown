I am starting a new section called 
[What Runs Your Start-up](/blog/categories/what-runs/) where I will
write about the technologies running behind some interesting
start-up companies and why they made their technological choices.
The articles will be short and to the point. Interested readers
can engage in discussion with start-up owners in the comments later.


I am starting with a dozen companies from the Bulgarian start-up eco-system
and will present one or two start-ups per week.
If you'd like to read about a company which is not listed here or want to
promote your own just let me know.
