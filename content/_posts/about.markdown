My name is Alexander Todorov and this is how I look. It's pretty close!

I'm currently a contractor operating in the field of open source software and
quality engineering and a start-up owner with many ideas.

My professional interests cover vast amount of topics including but not limited
to Linux and open source, quality engineering, DevOps, cloud and
platform-as-a-service, programming with Python and Django.

I used to teach to students at Technical University of Sofia.
Nowadays I teach the
[QA and Automation 101](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101)
course at HackBulgaria!
