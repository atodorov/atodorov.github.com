My name is Alexander Todorov and this is how I look. It's pretty close!

I'm currently a contractor operating in the field of open source software and
quality engineering and a start-up owner with many ideas.
I also have some hard-earned certificates including:

* RHCE - Red Hat Certified Engineer - Oct 2008
* RHCI - Red Hat Certified Instructor - Oct 2009
* RHCVA - Red Hat Certified Virtualization Administrator - Sep 2010
* Red Hat Partner Platform Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011
* Red Hat Partner Virtualization Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011
* Red Hat Partner Middleware Certified Salesperson - Oct 2011

My professional interests cover vast amount of topics including but not limited
to Linux and open source, quality engineering, DevOps, cloud and
platform-as-a-service, programming with Python and Django.

I used to teach to students at Technical University Of Sofia with my friends
[Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) and [Kiril Kamburov](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/kirilkamburov)
but I don't have the time for this anymore. 

You can always ping me if you'd like to chat or have a beer. See <http://about.me/atodorov>
or execute this command to see my email:

I am usually working on several things at a time or affiliated with more than one
organization. This list contains current ventures and some of the more interesting
previous ones.


Shoes 41 Plus
--------------

[Shoes 41 Plus](http://obuvki41plus.com) is niche oriented business selling ladies shoes with
sizes EU 41 and up, which are very hard to find in Bulgaria. We're also not shy to sell to men
who prefer ladies shoes!
<br />


Open Technologies Bulgaria
---------------------------

!["OTB"](/images/logos/otb.png "OTB")

[Open Technologies Bulgaria, Ltd](http://otb.bg) is a company I founded in 2009 which
mainly does open source consulting for some local clients and QA services to Red Hat, Inc. It's
also an authorized
[Red Hat re-seller in Bulgaria](http://redhat.force.com/finder/PFPartnerDetail?id=0016000000LxykhAAB).


Red Hat
-------

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="/images/logos/redhat.png" alt="RedHat" />

[Red Hat, Inc.](http://redhat.com) is the largest enterprise Linux vendor as you probably know.
I used to work for them as an employee and still continue to do so as a contractor. My main responsibility
is making sure Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and some other products) get to customers without too
many bugs and behave as quality software. I'm highly biased towards all Red Hat products but
a) they didn't fail me once and b) I know how much hard work is done into making these products
kick ass.



Difio
-----

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="/images/logos/difio.png" alt="Difio" />

[Difio](http://www.dif.io) was a service targeted at developers
who use open source packages and libraries. It shut down on Sept 10th 2014.
<br /><br />

One Laptop Per Child Bulgarian Chapter
--------------------------------------

<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="/images/logos/olpcbg.png" alt="OLPC.bg" />

[OLPC](http://laptop.org) was a project to build an entirely new laptop device and software for the children
in developing countries. I was a co-founder of the Bulgarian chapter of this project.
While the upstream project delivered a hardware and a software platform it failed rather miserably.
Our local chapter didn't get much support and gradually ceased operations.


I also own some domains. If you are interested just ask!
