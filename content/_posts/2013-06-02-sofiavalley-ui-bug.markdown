[SofiaValley](http://sofiavalley.com) recently had a bug in their UI.
As seen above when clicking the Like button the widget would overlap with
other visual elements. At first this doesn't look like a big deal but it blocks
the user from sharing the page via Facebook which is important for a blog.

I have reported the error and it was fixed very quickly. +1 for SofiaValley.

Have you spotted any other interesting bugs? Let me know and they will be published
here.
