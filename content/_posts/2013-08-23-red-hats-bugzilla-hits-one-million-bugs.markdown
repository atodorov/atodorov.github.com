Red Hat's Bugzilla passed the 1 million bugs milestone yesterday!
[RHBZ #1000000](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000) has been
filed by Anton Arapov, a kernel engineer and a very nice guy (I know him btw).
I've filed several bugs yesterday but the last one was #999941. A bit too short!

To celebrate this event I dare you to pick some bugs from Bugzilla that you find
interesting or frustrating and I will try to analyze and explain them from a
QA engineer's point of view. Since I've reported over 1000 bugs and been involved in
another close to 5000 I think I will be able to answer almost any question.

Challenge accepted!
