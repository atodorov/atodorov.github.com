At [SEETEST](http://seetest.org) this year I visited only tracks related to
management and leadership. The presentation
*How good leadership makes you a great team player* by Jeroen Rosink
was of particular interest to me. He talked about
[situational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory).

According to Hersey &amp; Blanchard each situation/person is different and it requires
a leader or manager to adjust their style in order to be successful. In particular
as a leader you have to approach each team, person and skill differently based on how
developed they are. In this context a skill can be any technical or non-technical
skill, a particular competence level required or anything really. The idea is that
for ever item that we would like to develop we would go through the cycle shown
on the image above.

Directing
---------

Every new employee, team member, junior IT specialist starts with some directing.
This is the phase where you tell people what they have to do and how to do it
exactly. This is the phase of the almighty boss who provides the what, how,
why, when and where!

In this phase an inexperienced(or new) person will figure out what is required
of them and give them detailed steps of how to achieve it.
Experienced team members will quickly find their bearings and transition out
of this phase.


Coaching
--------

In this phase the individual has already acquired some skills but they are not
fully developed. In addition to tasks here we also focus at supporting the individual to improve
their skills and deepen the connection and trust between them and the leader. This
is the basis of creating strong commitment in the future.

Think about coaches of sport teams. What they do is give direction in order to
create the best players/teams.


Supporting
----------

This phase comes naturally after coaching. Here we can also make the parallel with
sport teams. In this phase team members are already competent in their skills but
somewhat inconsistent in their performance and not very committed to the
end goal of the team (e.g. winning, testing all bugs, delivering software on time).

This is the phase in which
shared decisions are taken (what to test, how we should test, how to split the
tasks between team members) and in which teams are formed.
Here a leader must focus less on the particular tasks and much more on the
relationships within the group (don't forget the leader is also part of the group).


Delegating
----------

This is the end phase in which we have individuals with strong skills and strong
commitment. They are able to work and progress on their own. The job of the leader
here is to monitor progress and still be part of some decisions. What I've seen
people who I believe were delegating do is mostly
reaffirm the decisions taken by the team.

In this phase there's no need for the leader to focus on tasks and relationship
but rather high level goals and IMO providing opportunities for growth of
each individual team member. This is the phase where future leaders will come from.


What that means for the team ?
------------------------------

Notice the smaller section in the image above titled *Development Level*!
While an individual or a team is going through the different phases of
leadership they also go through various stages of development. At the end
of the cycle we get individuals with very strong skills and very strong
commitment and work ethics.


What that means for the leader ?
--------------------------------

(stats from presentation at the conference)

1. 54% of leaders can use only 1 style
2. 34% of leaders can use 2 styles
3. 11% of leaders can use 3 styles
4. 1% of leaders can use 4 styles

This means as leaders we have a lot to learn if we want to become effective.
We have to learn to recognize at what stage of development an organization and/or
a team is and what are the various stages of development of individual team members.
Then apply this model as appropriate.

A side note: I am currently working with a group of young developers on an open source
project where all of them are pretty much at the beginning of their journey. They
lack almost all necessary technical skills that are needed to work on the project
and their profiles, including age are very similar to one another. I believe this is
an ideal situation to apply this model and see how it goes (expect results in a year or so).

Note2: I will have 2 more developers joining the same project a bit later and I expect
one of them to be able to get up to speed faster (so far I have observed very
impressive self-development in them) so that will spice things up a bit :)


Bonus question
--------------

Do you remember
[The 4 Basic Communication Styles]({filename}2016-10-09-4-communication-styles.markdown)
post from last year? I have the feeling that these styles are very much related
to the leadership strategies described above. For example Director is using the directing style,
Expresser sounds a lot like a coach to me and Harmonizer is using the supporting style.
Only a Thinker doesn't quite fit but on the other hand they can be quite self-driven
and not need supervision.

I don't know if there's something here or I'm totally making things up. I'd love to
get some insights from psychologists, leadership experts and communication experts.
