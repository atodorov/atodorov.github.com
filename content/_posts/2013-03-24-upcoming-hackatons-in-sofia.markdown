[Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
have been organized in Sofia and generally through Bulgaria for the
past several years but as far as I know they were mostly underground events.
There are two upcoming events which are somewhat different. 

"Record Voting" Hackathon
-------------------------

Organized by [INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT](http://iped.bg/en)
this hackathon is the first I know of, which will focus on government provided data.
The objective is to process data
([sample](http://results.cik.bg/el2011_t1.zip)) from the 2011 elections
and find persons who were able to vote in the last minute, between 20:00-21:00 hours thus
changing the election results by 20% in their voting section.

The event starts at 09:29 on 30th Mar 2013 @ [betahaus Sofia](http://www.betahaus.bg).
More info in Bulgarian [here](http://bogomil.info/4805) and
[here](http://iped.bg/bg/news-read/news1c).

I'd love to attend but will be visiting a conference about mobile devices in
another town at the same time :(. If you do attend, let me know how fun it was.

Dare to read more on the topic about open government? I recommend starting with
*Open Government: Collaboration, Transparency, and Participation in Practice by
Daniel Lathrop and Laurel Ruma* (

). This is an excellent book with tons of examples and easy to read.


HackFMI
-------

![HackFMI](/images/hackfmi/cropped-hackfmi.png "HackFMI")

FMI stands for *Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the Sofia University* 
(not where I graduated). It's one of the
best, arguably the best, places to study for an IT career. Like most other universities in Bulgaria
its administration and processes suck big time!

[HackFMI](http://hackfmi.com/) is the first ever hackathon which will focus on students
improving faculty/university systems and processes. This is HUGE! As far as I know it is also the first
hackathon which is supported by academia. 

I have already [volunteered](https://github.com/Hackfmi/Organization-Details/pull/2) to be
a mentor at HackFMI. I am looking forward to this. It will be fun. See you there!
