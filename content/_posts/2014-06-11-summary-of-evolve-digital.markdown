![Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs](/images/evolve_digital.jpg "Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs")

Yesterday I've visited an event organized by the 
[Atlantic Club of Bulgaria](http://www.atlantic-club.org/index.php?en) which
officially marked the launch of a digital national alliance in Bulgaria. This is
part of an initiative of the European Commission, called 
[Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs),
which aims to address the lack of
sufficient amount and quality professionals in Europe working in the
field of Information and Communication technologies.

The first part was few short keynotes, including one from deputy prime minister
and memorandum signing and group photo. In the keynotes (and afterwards)
the stress was on the lack of relevant ICT skills and the need of an estimated
1 million digital workers by 2020 in EU alone.

The next two sessions were panel discussions. The first one presenting the local 
chapter of the Digital Coalition in Bulgaria. 

The goals of the coalition are to:

* help more people master more digital skills (not only as developers but also
proper usage of social media, how to create content, etc)
* enable more people to choose digital jobs
* help local talents present themselves on the global scene

How it (is supposed to) works:

* initiate own ideas and propose them for implementation (to the ICT industry and broad public I guess)
* stimulate learning through doing, learning by example using real use cases
* help (and possibly sponsor) outside projects and ideas

Then the various companies supporting the coalition pledged how they are going to
help. The most interesting news from this panel was the announcement of a new HP
data center in Sofia which will be used as a training lab with access available to
students.


The second panel was about education and how to bridge the gap! The interesting points were:

* Ministry of Education and Science admits they have finally realized that our educational
system and programs are behind current tendencies and need concrete steps in order to boost
education and science research;
* Samsung will open their innovation lab at Sofia University to outside students as well;
* We need to pay more attention to content and training of teachers because they also have
a skills gap while young children do not;

I particularly liked what Prof. Petar Kenderov from the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics
at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences said - in the outside world children are constantly sharing
and communicating with each other while at school (also to some extent in universities) they
are expected to not communicate, not share and keep quiet. He emphasized the value of learning through
experimentation vs. learning through reading and writing, e.g. the current way things work
and the old way of teaching. 


Another thing that was obvious was that otherwise competing companies (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
VMware) were working together to fix some of the problems mentioned. However I'm a bit skeptical
that large multi-national companies will be flexible enough to make a positive change.
I'd bet on the independent organizations like [HackBulgaria](https://hackbulgaria.com/) and
Svetlin Nakov's [Software University](https://softuni.bg/) or initiatives by local Bulgarian companies
like the already proven [Telerik Academy](http://academy.telerik.com/).

Here's the entire program of the event, for anyone interested:
