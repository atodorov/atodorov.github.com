Hello everyone, this year I've been to FOSDEM again. Here is a quick report
of what I did, saw and liked during the event.


Day 0 - Elixir & Erlang
-----------------------

Friday started with an unexpected shopping trip. The airline broke
my luggage and I had to buy a replacement. The irony is that just before taking off
I saw a guy with an

and thought how cool that was. The next day I was running around Brussels to
find the exact same model! I also searched to buy the book

by Edward De Bono but all 4 bookstores I checked were out of stock.

With the luggage problem solved I headed to
[BetaCowork](http://betacowork.com) for
[Brussels Erlang Factory Lite](http://www.erlang-factory.com/brussels2016/)
where I learned a bit about Erlang and Elixir. I also managed to squeeze a meeting
with [Gilbert West](http://www.betacowork.com/profile/122/gilbert-west/) talking about
open source bugs.

I found particularly interesting the Elixir workshop and the talk
[Erlang In The Wild: A Governmental Web Application](http://www.erlang-factory.com/brussels2016/pieterjan-montens)
by Pieterjan Montens. Later I've managed to get a hold of him and talk some more
about his experiences working for the government. As I figured out later we
are likely to have mutual friends.

BetaCowork was hosting FOSDEM related events during the entire week.
There was a GNOME event and the Libre Office Italian team was there as well.
Next time definitely worth a longer visit.

Friday night was reserved for a dinner with the Red Hat Eclipse team and
a fair amount of beer at Delirium afterwards where I've met my friend
[Giannis Konstantinidis](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giannisk)
and the new Fedora Ambassador for Albania -
[Jona Azizai](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jonatoni).

All-in-all pretty good Friday!


Day 1 - Testing and Automation
------------------------------

![Testing and Automation](/images/fosdem/2014/testing_automation.jpg "Testing and Automation")

FOSDEM was hosting the
[Testing and automation devroom](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/)
again. I've spent the entire Saturday there.

Definitely the most interesting talk was
[Testing interoperability with closed-source software through scriptable diplomacy](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/closed_source_interop/)
which introduced [Frida](http://frida.re). Frida is a testing tool which injects
a JavaScript VM into your process and you can write scripts driving the
application automatically. It was designed as means to control closed source
software but can definitely be used for open source apps as well.

I've talked to both Karl and Ole about Frida and my use-case for
[testing interactive terminal programs]({filename}2016-01-14-controlling-interactive-terminal-programs.markdown).
That should be easy to do with Frida - just hook into the read and write
functions and write some JavaScript or Python to run the test.
Later we talked about how exactly Frida attaches to the running process
and what external dependencies are needed if I'm to inject Frida
into the Fedora installation environment.


In *Testing embedded systems* Itamar Hassin talked about testing medical devices
and made a point about regulation, security and compliance. Basically you are not
allowed to ship non-application code on production system. However that code
is necessary instrumentation to allow external integration testing. I suspect most
developers and QA engineers will never have to deal with so strict
regulations but that is something to have in mind if you test software
in a heavily regulated industry.

*Testing complex software in CI* was essentially a presentation about *cwrap* which
I've seen at
[FOSDEM 2014]({filename}2014-02-03-fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation.markdown).
It touched the topic from a slightly different angle though. Tests in any open source
project should have the following properties

* Be able to execute without the need of a complex environment;
* Enable full CI during code review (dependent on previous property);
* Be able to create complete integration tests.

The demo showed how you can execute Samba's test suite locally without
preparing a domain controller for example. This helps both devel and external
contributors. Now contrast this with how Red Hat QE will do the testing - 
they will create a bunch of virtual and bare metal machines, configure all
related services and then execute the same test scripts to verify that indeed
Samba works as expected.

Btw I've been thinking what if I patch *cwrap* to overwrite read and write ?
That will also make it possible to test interactive console programs,
wouldn't it?


*Jenkins as Code* by Marcin and Lukasz was a blast. I think there were
people standing alongside the walls. The guys shared their experience
with [Jenkins Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin)
plugin. The plugin is very flexible and powerful,
using Groovy as its programming language. The only drawback is that it is
sometimes too complex to use and requires a steep learning curve. Maybe
[Jenkins Job Builder](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/)
is better suited if you don't need all that flexibility
and complexity. I've met both of them afterwards and talked a bit more
about open source bugs.

At Saturday evening I've visited a panel discussion about
[the impact of open source on the tech industry](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/startupbusaccelerate-the-impact-of-open-source-software-on-the-tech-industry-tickets-20869395925)
at [Co.Station](http://co-station.com) organized by [The Startup Bus](http://europe.startupbus.com).
There was beer, pizza, entrepreneur networking and talking about startups
and open source. Do I need to say more? I will post a separate blog post
about the interesting start-ups I've found so stay tuned.


Day 2 - Ping-pong with BBC Open Source
--------------------------------------

![ping-pong](/images/bbc_ping_pong.jpg "ping-pong")

Sunday was my lazy day. I've attended a few talks but nothing too interesting.
I've managed to go around the project stands, 
[filed a bug against FAS](https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5085)
and scored the highest ping-pong score for the day at the BBC Open Source stand.

BBC has a long history of being involved with education in the UK and the
[micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk) is their latest project. I will love to
see this (or similar) delivered by the thousands here in Bulgaria so if you
think about sponsoring let me know.

Accidentally I met
[Martin Sivak](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Msivak) - a former
Anaconda developer whom I've worked with in the past. He is now at the
Virtualization Development team at Red Hat and we briefly talked about
the need for more oVirt testing. I have something in mind about this
which will be announced in the next 2 months so stay tuned.
