I've recently found Nibbler which gives you a report scoring the website out of
10 for various important criteria including accessibility, SEO, social media
and technology.

The produced report is very interesting. Here is the
[report for this blog](http://nibbler.silktide.com/reports/atodorov.org). 
There are things I definitely need to work on!

For comparison [SofiaValley](http://nibbler.silktide.com/reports/sofiavalley.com)
scores far beyond this blog. It is stronger in marketing and popularity but
apparently weaker on the technology section. This is interesting!


PS: sorry for not producing technical content lately. I've been very busy
with some current projects however I've got lots of ideas and topics to blog about. 
I hope to make it up to speed in the next few weeks. -- Alex
