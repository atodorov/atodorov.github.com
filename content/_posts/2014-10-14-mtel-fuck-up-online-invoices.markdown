Prompted by [Rado's](http://radorado.me/) post about
[Mtel not fixing a business customer Internet connection](https://www.facebook.com/radorado.radoslav.georgiev/posts/10204276374941470)
I want to tell you a story about how the big company totally fucked up their
online invoice system and give you a few more hints about how stupidity
reigns supreme even in big companies, especially in Bulgaria.

I've never received a paper invoice for my phone bill and used the website to access any information
about my bills and calls duration, etc. The problem is that I ported my number to another operator.

**Porting a number away from Mtel automatically cuts access to your previous invoices online**

The problem in technical terms
------------------------------

This is a tech blog so let's be technical. Users can register at Mtel's website via
username and password. If they are customers then they can add their numbers to their
profile. Once the number is verified (via SMS code), the user has access to additional services
one of which is online invoices and monthly usage reports.

Migrating away to another operator "erases" your number from the system but
this is not true actually. All the information is still there because they can give me
print outs if I pay all the extra fees and simply because no business will voluntarily
erase their database records.

**The genius who designed the *if-number-migrated-then-delete-from-user-profile-and-cut-off-access*
business process/software implementation is the biggest idiot in the world.**


How Mtel handled my complaint
-----------------------------

My request for
explanation (see below) was answered with a nice letter, basically telling me to piss off. None of my
questions were answered. To make things worse they want to charge extra fees for detailed print outs. 

What I've asked for:

* To be granted access back to all of my invoices online. Not only I paid for them but this
is something of a personal information;
* To be given copies of my last 5 invoices, preferably via email;
* To be given explanation why my online access to previous invoices was cut off;
* Mtel to stop doing this and allow access to online invoices for everyone of their past
or current customers;

I've also told them I'm available to help them fix their system if they don't have
the resources to do so (hint, hint: it's an if-then condition or something very close I bet).
