Two hours ago I've heard on the radio about
[the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://acl2013.org/site/)
which is held at the moment in Sofia
According to the guest speaker (a professor from Bulgarian Academy of Science) the official
program will be over today but the next two days will feature workshops and tutorials.

Definitely not to be missed if you are in Sofia. I'm not unfortunately :(.
If you can please visit and share what you saw with me. Thanks!
