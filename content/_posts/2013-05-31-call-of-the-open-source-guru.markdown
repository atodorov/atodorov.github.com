This week (28.05.2013) I've attended an interesting
[event](https://www.facebook.com/events/244624942345762/248165165325073/), called 
“Call of the Guru”, that was held at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at
Sofia University. The idea was to get a group of IT professionals (gurus) to talk to
young students on topics related to work, academia, start-up and open source.

In [another post](/blog/2013/05/27/it-jobs-prediction-quality-engineering-devops-augmented-reality/)
I've already shared my thoughts on future IT jobs. Here I will talk about what open source
means for students.

Why hack open source
--------------------

That's the number one question students will ask. The answer is simple
{% blockquote %}
It gives you experience and you become a hacker!
{% endblockquote %}

There is absolutely no way one could graduate in their early 20s, not work
during study and have 3-5 years of experience as required by many job offers.
Unless one hacks open source. 

* Open source is real world, not a play project. There are many interesting problems
to be solved; There's always work to be done;
* Complex software teaches you software design/architecture patterns;
* Larger projects like Linux distributions can also teach you about software release
cycle and release processes;
* You work with a team, which drives you forward and you gain experience;
* You learn to be patient as your work is reviewed by others and mistakes pointed out;
* Larger projects use several different languages so you learn them; or alternatively
hack on different projects;
* You communicate - via email and IRC mostly but that teaches you communication
skills. To see the difference between how educated people talk and how politicians
talk listen to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJldn_MmMY);
* You make friends and connections which may benefit you later in your career;
* Many open source companies recruit right from the community. I know lots of
people who landed their dream job by hacking for fun.


As a student, if you can afford not getting a job it's better to use your time on
open source projects. This is what I did as a young student and a junior developer.
The rest is history!


What to do
----------

There are many things one can do in open source - write code, test software and
find bugs, write automated test cases, translate to local languages,
design user interfaces and project websites,
maintain wiki articles, provide help to users on forums or IRC channels, help organize
events, etc. All of this is respected in the community and gives credibility. 

Where to start
---------------

If you haven't already read [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) by
Eric Raymond you should do so right away. Then come back and finish this article.

For those who'd like to start coding but have no idea where to start take a look at
[OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/). 

{% blockquote %}
OpenHatch is a non-profit dedicated to matching prospective free software contributors with communities, tools, and education. 
{% endblockquote %}

If you still like to be a developer but don't feel confident enough to hack on the core of
the project I'd recommend you start by writing automated test cases. Writing test cases doesn't
require much previous experience in programming and lets you explore and learn the internals
of the software you're testing. With that knowledge you will become more confident and start
writing on the core features if you like. I am myself a QA but regularly contribute patches to
software I test because I know how it works or why it doesn't and it's easy for me to fix it.


If you'd better start as a translator check [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com).
It's used by both commercial and open source entities and has become the de-facto standard in
open source translation tools. Btw the entire Transifex company was build after trying to
solve a particular problem in the Fedora Project and they are an open source company.

For general news about open source check [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/).


Have questions? I have answers
------------------------------

Don't hesitate to ask me anything about open source and/or how to get involved with it.
I will gladly share my experience (learned the hard-way in the old days) or point you
to other folks who may know more on the topic.
