Here are two articles which I found very useful and interesting this week:


[Git Submodules: Adding, Using, Removing, Updating](http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/)
is a clear description of working with git submodules which I had to do recently.
There's a huge comments section with more useful info as well. 


[Stopping spambots with hashes and honeypots](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html)
is a very interesting read about non-CAPTCHA techniques to stop SPAM bots from filling forms
and comments on your site. I didn't even know these exist but I have to admin this is not my
area of expertise either. The author just scratches the surface of the topic and there are other
methods described in the comments as well. Make sure to read this if you are building forms
or sites with comments.
