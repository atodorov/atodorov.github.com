Did you know there is a start-up company producing men's shoes? Me neither,
and I love good quality shoes.

Beckett Simonon launched in 2012, and slashed prices by working with local manufacturers and
selling directly to customers online.

The company, which currently operates out of Bogota, Colombia, says it has 
generated $80,000 in revenue after two months in operation, and has five employees.

From what I can tell [Beckett Simonon](http://www.beckettsimonon.com) produce nice shoes.
I would rate them between very good and high quality, just looking at the pictures.
All designs are very classy and stylish, which is rare these days. Leather looks
high quality, soles too.

The ones I loved right away are the Bailey Chukka Boot model, shown here.
So far my gut feeling about shoes has never been wrong, even on the Internet, so
I'm thinking to pre-order a pair.

Anybody wants to team up for a joint order?
