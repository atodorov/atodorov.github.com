Publishing this mostly for self reference.
Here are two blog posts on the topic of testing time
dependent code in Ruby applications:

[Synchronized Times In Ruby & JavaScript Acceptance Tests Using Capybara, Timecop & Sinon.JS](http://metaskills.net/2012/08/07/synchronized-times-in-ruby-and-javascript-acceptance-tests-using-capybara-timecop-and-sinon-js/)

[Move Over Timecopâ€¦Hello ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers](https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/goodbye-timecop-hello-timehelpers)

I haven't seen a module similar to timecop in Python, but frankly I've never needed one either.
