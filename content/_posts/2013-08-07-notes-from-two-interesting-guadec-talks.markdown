As this year's [GUADEC](https://www.guadec.org/) is coming to an end
I'm publishing an interesting update from 
[Petr Muller](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/mullerpetr) for 
those who were not able to attend.
Petr is a Senior Quality Engineer at Red Hat. His notes were
sent to an internal QE mailing list and re-published with permission.

    As this year's GUADEC happened in the same building where I have my
    other office, I decided to attend. I'm sharing my notes from the two
    sessions I consider to be especially interesting for the audience of
    this mailing list:
    
    == How to not report your UX bug ==
    Speaker:    Fabiana Sim√µes
    Blog:       http://fabianapsimoes.wordpress.com/

    Do not do this stuff:
    * Do not simply present a preferred solution, but describe a problem (a
    difficulty you are having, etc.)
    * Do not use "This sucks" idiom, not even hidden in false niceties like
    "It's not user friendly"
    * Do not talk for majority, when you are not entitled to ("most users
    would like")
    * Do not consider all UX issues as minor: an inability to do stuff is
    not a minor issue
    
    What is actually interesting for the designer in a report?
    * What were you trying to do?
    * Why did you want to do it?
    * What did you do?
    * What happened?
    * What were your expectations?
    
    More notes
    * Write as much as needed
    * Describe what you see, did and *how you felt*
    * Print screen is your friend!
    * *Give praise*
    
    == Extreme containment measures: keeping bug reports under control ==
    Speaker:  Jean-Francois Fortin Tam
    Homepage: http://jeff.ecchi.ca

    Discussed the problem lot of OS projects are having: lot of useless
    (old, irrelevant, waiting for decision no one wants to make) bug/rfe
    reports in their bug tracking systems. Lots of food for thought about
    our own projects, internal or external. Clever applications of
    principles from personal productivity systems such as GTD and Inbox Zero
    for bug tracking.  
    
    The talk was mostly an applied version of this blog post, which is worth
    reading:
    http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/10/08/reducing-our-core-apps-software-inventory/

I particularly like the UX bug reporting guide lines. Need to take those into
account when reporting UI issues. 

I still haven't read the second blog post which also looks interesting although 
not very applicable to me. After all I'm the person reporting bugs not the one
who decides what and when gets fixed.
