Earlier I wrote about my
[personal experience with credit card fraud](/blog/2013/04/26/personal-experience-with-credit-card-fraud/).
Now this issue is back again! Bad luck!

Since my last card was re-issued I've used it **only** at Amazon Web Services, Google Apps and Globul. Nowhere else.
According to the bank representative, who woke me up this morning,
VISA has sent them a list of card numbers which need to be blocked immediately. The bank was vague about
it but briefly mentioned some kind of a leak of VISA's card database.

Knowing how negligent payment operators can be I can easily accept this version. I'm wondering if there
will be an official press release from VISA. Let me know if you hear about this!
