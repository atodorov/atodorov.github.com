Today I have released pylint-django version 2.0 on PyPI.
The changes are centered around compatibility with the latest pylint 2.0 and
astroid 2.0 versions. I've also bumped pylint-django's version number to reflact
that.

A major component, class transformations, was updated so don't be surprised if
there are bugs. All the existing test cases pass but you never know what sort
of edge case there could be.

I'm also hosting a workshop/corporate training about writing pylint plugins.
If you are interested see this [page](http://MrSenko.com/pylint-workshop/)!


Thanks for reading and happy testing!
