I like to buy books, the real ones, printed on paper. This however comes at
a certain price when buying from Amazon. The book price itself is
usually bearable but many times shipping costs to Bulgaria
will double the price. Especially if you are making a single book order.


To save money I started buying used books when available. For books that are
not so popular I look for items that have been owned by a library.

This is how I got a hardcover 1984 edition of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190676820X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=190676820X&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">The Gentlemen's Clubs of London</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=190676820X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Anthony Lejeune for $10. This is my best deal so far.
The book was brand new I dare to say. There was no edge wear, no damaged pages,
with nice and vibrant colors. The second page had the library sign and no other marks.


Let me know if you had an experience buying used books online? Did you score a great
deal like I did?
