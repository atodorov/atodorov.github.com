laptop plus all books
from my [Give Away List](/blog/2013/04/05/give-away-list/), which are not currently taken.
Because this is not much I have an offer for everyone else, who would like to help. 

<div style="clear:both"></div>

What is the offer
------------------

**Give a book or your old laptop and get a new one with discount!**.

My company 
[Open Technologies Bulgaria, Ltd.](http://otb.bg) is an authorized reseller of Vali Computers and
Fujitsu. Hardware reselling is not the main company activity but a backup in case a customer
wants to purchase entire solution from one vendor. 

I will not charge the standard reseller's discount (between 5% and 10%) if you drop-off your books
or old laptops with me and agree to donated them to children.
The offer is valid as long as the donation campaign is (I don't know how long but looks like ongoing). 

You can select anything from <http://www.vali.bg> with the reseller's discount off! 
Delivery or pick-up is on you though.

If you want to participate use the comments below and I will get in touch with you.
