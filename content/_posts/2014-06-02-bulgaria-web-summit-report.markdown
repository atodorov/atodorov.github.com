Last week ended up with [Bulgaria Web Summit](http://bulgariawebsummit.com/).
The event was very big this year, with 4 halls and 600 visitors.
I was moderating the so called *JavaScript* hall and will concentrate on
what happened there.

This is what my hall looked like at around 10:00 and stayed pretty much the same
during the entire day.

Speakers at hall Rhodopi were (in order of appearance)

* [Delian Delchev](https://twitter.com/delian) talking about the JavaScript
revolution taking over the world and how this language has become the most
widely used programming language in the world.
* [Haralan Dobrev](https://twitter.com/hkdobrev) with some tips about development
workflows, git, continuous integration and unit testing.
* Yoga for Geeks during the lunch break.
* Boyan Dzhumakov with topics about home automation and Internet of things, who
demonstrated his bed side lamp controlled via a light sensor and Arduino.
* [Neven Boyanov](http://www.boyanov.org/) continuing on the hardware topics with
comparison of ATmel, Arduino and Raspberry Pi and showing more examples of
small programmable devices.
* [Angel Todorov](https://twitter.com/attodorov) from Infragistics with a very
interesting talk about JavaScript instrumentation for performance analysis.
A very cool presentation and you should definitely check out his
[cheetah.js](https://github.com/attodorov/cheetah.js) framework.
* [Krasimir Tsonev](https://twitter.com/KrasimirTsonev) with 
[AbsurdJS](http://absurdjs.com/) - a JavaScript library with superpowers.
Teaser: Krasimir is also publishing a book caled
[Node.js Blueprints](https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/472723298053537792).
* [Vasil Kolev](https://twitter.com/krokodilerian) with a talk about security
and web service design and how most of the web is doing it wrong :).


Unfortunately there is no video or audio recording available. If you find
some of the talks interesting and would like to get more info about it let
me know. I will ask the presenters to share their slides or give more details
where possible.


Don't worry if you've missed the Web Summit in Sofia. There will be another one
in the autumn, held at Veliko Tarnovo. For more info please subscribe to the
