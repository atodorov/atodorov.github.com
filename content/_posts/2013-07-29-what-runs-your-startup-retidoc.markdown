[RETiDoc](http://retidoc.com/) automates personal ID data entry, speeding up
customer service and eliminating costly errors. The product is based on OCR
algorithms and could be used on hardware devices scanning the ID card or
through a compact scanner box specially designed for the need. The main problem
tackled by RETiDoc is manual data entry at service providers, 
which is a time consuming, low-customer satisfaction process, filled with
expensive typos and low productivity at provider’s front offices.

Co-founder Martin Kulov takes us behind the scenes.


Main Technologies
-----------------

RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and [Team Foundation Service](https://tfs.visualstudio.com/).

Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!


Why Not Something Else?
-----------------------

Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don't have the time to fill-in the details.

Hopefully they will do so in the future.
