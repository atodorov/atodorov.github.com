On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
[Fedora Test Days](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days) at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
[conference](http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&key=459487176).
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
[Fedora 20 test days](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days)
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick 
some developers' ass this is the way to do it!

Other talks include Alexander Shopov's „Oracle's take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.

The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see [map](http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png)).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!

[retiring my laptop](/blog/2013/08/01/laptop-vs-smartphone-part-one/).
