Due to popular demand I'm sharing my plans for the upcoming conference season.
Here is a list of events I plan to visit and speak at (hopefully). The list
will be updated throughout the year so please subscribe to the comments section
to receive a notification when that happens! I'm open to meeting new people so
ping me for a beer if you are attending some of these events!

02 February - Hack Belgium Pre-Event Workshops, Brussels
---------------------------------------------------------

**Note: added on Jan 12th**

Last year I had an amazing time visiting an
[Elixir & Erlang workshop]({filename}2016-02-02-fosdem-2016-report.markdown) so
I'm about to repeat the experience. I will be visiting a
[workshop](http://www.hackathon.com/event/hack-belgium-pre-event-workshops-29372270251)
organized by HackBelgium and keep you posted with the results.


03 February - Git Merge, Brussels
---------------------------------

**Note: added on Jan 12th**

[Git Merge](http://git-merge.com/) is organized by GitHub and will be held in Brussels
this year. I will be visiting only the conference track and hopefully giving a lightning talk
titled *Automatic upstream dependency testing with GitHub API*! That and the afterparty
of course!


04-05 February - FOSDEM, Brussels
---------------------------------

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) is the largest free and open source gathering
in Europe which I have been visiting since 2009 (IIRC). You can checkout some
of my reports about
[FOSDEM 2014, Day 1]({filename}2014-02-03-fosdem-2014-report-day-1-python-stands-lightning-talks.markdown),
[FOSDEM 2014, Day 2]({filename}2014-02-03-fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation.markdown) and
[FOSDEM 2016]({filename}2016-02-02-fosdem-2016-report.markdown).

I will present my
[Mutants, tests and zombies](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/mutant_testing/)
talk at the *Testing & Automation devroom* on Sunday.

**UPDATE:** Video recording is available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyKvwODy9jw&list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db)

I will be in Brussels between February 1st and 5th to explore the local
start-up scene and get to meet with the Python community so ping me if you are around.


18 March - QA Challenge Accepted 3.0, Sofia
-------------------------------------------

[QA: Challenge Accepted](http://qachallengeaccepted.com/) is a specialized QA conference
in Sofia and most of the sessions are in Bulgarian. I've visited last year and it was great.
I even proposed a [challenge of my own]({filename}2016-03-25-hello-world-bug-challenge.markdown).

CFP is still open but I have a strong confidence that my talk
*Testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux the MicroSoft way* will be approved. It will describe
a large scale experiment with pairwise testing, which btw I learned about at
QA: Challenge Accepted 2.0 :).

**UPDATE:** I will be also on the jury for *QA of the year* award.

**UPDATE:** I did a lightning talk about my
[test case management system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14e1z-pYwMc) (in Bulgarian).


07-08 April - Bulgaria Web Summit, Sofia
----------------------------------------

I have been a moderator at
[Bulgaria Web Summit](https://bulgariawebsummit.com/) for several years and this year
is no exception. This is one of the strongest events held in Sofia and is in English.
Last year over 60% of the attendees were from abroad so you are welcome!

I'm not going to speak at this event but will record as much of it
as possible. **UPDATE:** Checkout the recordings on my
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW8wjpK-hRg&list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&index=11)
channel!


10-12 May - Romanian Testing Conference, Cluj-Napoca
----------------------------------------------------

[RTC'17](http://romaniatesting.ro/) is a new event I found in neighboring Romania.
The topic this year is *Thriving and remaining relevant in Quality Assurance*. My talk is titled
*Quality Assistance in the Brave New World* where I'll share some experiences
and visions for the QA profession if that gets accepted.


As it turned out I know a few people living in Cluj so I'll be arriving one day earlier
on May 9th to meet the locals.


13-14 May - OSCAL, Tirana
-------------------------

[Open Source Conference Albania](http://oscal.openlabs.cc/) is the largest OSS event in
the country. I'm on a row here to explore the IT scene on the Balkans. Due to traveling
constraints my availability will be limited to the conference venue only but I've booked
a hotel across the street :).

I will be meeting a few friends in Tirana and hear about the progress of an
[psychological experiment]({filename}2016-11-21-openfest.markdown) we devised
with Jona Azizaj and Suela Palushi.

Talking wise I'm hoping to get the chance of introducing mutation testing and
even host a workshop on the topic.

**UPDATE:** Here is the video recording from
[OSCAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG1eAhMWZJ8). The quality is very poor though.

20-21 May - DEVit, Thessaloniki
-------------------------------

This is the 3rd edition of [DEVit](http://devitconf.org/),
the 360Â° web development conference of Northern Greece. I've been a regular
visitor since the beginning and this year I've proposed a session on mutation
testing. Because the Thessaloniki community seems more interested in Ruby and Rails
my goal is to share more examples from my Ruby work and compare how that is different
from the Python world. There is once again an opportunity for a workshop.

So far I've been the only Bulgarian to visit DEVit and also locally known as
"The guy who Kosta & Kosta met in Sofia"! Checkout my impressions from
[DEVit'15]({filename}2015-05-22-devit-conf-2015-impressions.markdown) and
[DEVit'16]({filename}2016-05-25-devit-conf-2016-impressions.markdown)
if you are still wondering whether to attend or not! I strongly recommend it!


**UPDATE:** I am still the only Bulgarian visiting DEVit!


22 May - Dev.bg, Sofia
----------------------

I've hosted a session titled *Quality Assurance According to Einstein* for the
local QA community in Sofia. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnxNCdX3iG0)
(in Bulgarian) and [links]({filename}2017-04-20-qa-eintein.markdown) are available!


**UPDATE:** added post-mortem.


01-02 June - Shift Developer Conference, Split
----------------------------------------------

[Shift](http://shift.codeanywhere.com/) appears to be a very big event in Croatia.
My attendance is still unconfirmed due to lots of traveling before that and
the general trouble of efficiently traveling on the Balkans. However I have a
CFP submitted and waiting for approval. This time it is my
*Mutation Testing in Patterns*, which is a journal of different code patterns
found during mutation testing. I have not yet presented it to the public
but will blog about it sometime soon so stay tuned.

**UPDATE:** this one is a no-go!


03-04 June - TuxCon, Plovdiv
-----------------------------

[TuxCon](http://tuxcon.mobi/) is held in Plovdiv around the beginning of July.
I'm usually presenting some lightning talks there and use the opportunity to
meet with friends and peers outside Sofia and catch up with news from the
local community. The conference is in Bulgarian with the exception of the
occasional foreign speaker. If you understand Bulgarian I recommend the
story of
[Puldin - a Bulgarian computer from the 80s]({filename}2016-07-12-testing-8bit-puldin.markdown).


**UPDATE:** I will be opening the conference with *QA According to Einstein*



17-18 June - How Camp, Varna
----------------------------

[How Camp](http://how.camp/) is the little brother of Bulgaria Web Summit and is always
held outside of Sofia. This year it will be in Varna, Bulgaria. I will be there of course
and depending on the crowd may talk about some software testing patterns.


**UPDATE:** it looks like this is also a no-go but stay tuned for the upcoming
*Macedonia Web Summit* and *Albania Web Summit* where yours trully will probably
be a moderator!

25-29 September - SuSE CON, Prague
----------------------------------

Yeah, this is the [conference organized by SuSE](http://www.susecon.com). I'm definitely
not afraid to visit the competition. I even hope I could teach them something. More
details are still TBA because this event is very close to/overlapping with the next
two.


28-29 September - SEETEST, Sofia
--------------------------------

[South East European Software Testing Conference](http://seetest.org) is, AFAIK,
an international event which is hosted in a major city on the Balkans. Last year it was
held in Bucharest with previous years held in Sofia.

In my view this is the most formal event, especially related to software testing,
I'm about to visit. Nevertheless I like to hear about new ideas and some research
in the field of QA so this is a good opportunity.

**UPDATE:** I have submitted a new talk titled
*If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts!*


30 September-1 October - HackConf, Sofia
---------------------------------------

[HackConf](https://hackconf.bg) is one of the largest conferences in Bulgaria, gathering
over 1000 people each year. I am strongly affiliated with the people who organize it
and even had the opportunity to host the opening session last year. The picture above
is from this event.

The audience is still very young and inexperienced but the presenters are above average.
Organizers' goal is HackConf to become the strongest technical conference in the country
and also serve as a sort of inspiration for young IT professionals.

**UPDATE:** I have submitted both a talk proposal and a workshop proposal.
For the workshop I intend to teach children
[Python and Selenium Automation in 8 hours]({filename}2017-05-27-qa-python-selenium-101-retro.markdown).
I've also been helping the organizers with bringing some very cool speakers
from abroad!



October - IT Weekend, Bulgaria
------------------------------

[IT Weekend](http://it-weekend.com/) is organized by Petar Sabev, the same person who's
behind QA: Challenge Accepted. It is a non-formal gathering of engineers with the intent
to share some news and then discuss and share problems and experiences. Checkout my
review of
[IT Weekend #1]({filename}2016-10-08-it-weekend-1.markdown) and
[IT Weekend #3]({filename}2016-11-02-it-weekend-3.markdown).

The topic revolve around QA, leadership and management but the format is open and the
intention is to broaden the topics covered. The event is held outside Sofia at a SPA
hotel and makes for a very nice retreat. I don't have a topic but I'm definitely going
if time allows. I will probably make something up if we have QA slots available :).


October - Software Freedom Kosova, Prishtina
---------------------------------------------

[Software Freedom Kosova](http://sfk.flossk.org) is one of the oldest conferences
about free and open source software in the region.
This is part of my goal to explore the IT communities on the Balkans.
Kosovo sounds a bit strange to visit but I did recognize a few names on the speaker
list of previous years.

The CFP is not open yet but I'm planning to make a presentation. Also if weather
allows I'm planning a road trip on my motorbike :).

**UPDATE:** I've met with some of the FLOSSK members in Tirana at OSCAL and they
seem to be more busy with running the hacker space in Prishtina so the conference
is nearly a no-go.


14-15 November - Google Test Automation Conference, London
-----------------------------------------------------------

[GTAC 2017](https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/)
will be held in London. Both speakers and attendees are pre-approved
and my goal is to be the first Red Hatter and second Bulgarian to speak at GTAC.

The previous two years saw talks about
[mutation testing vs. coverage]({filename}2016-12-27-mutation-vs-coverage.markdown)
and their respective use
to determine the quality of a test suite with both parties arguing against
each other. Since I'm working in both of these fields and have at least two
practical example I'm trying to gather more information and present my findings
to the world.

**UPDATE:** I've also submitted my *Testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux the Microsoft way*


16-17 November - ISTA Con, Sofia
---------------------------------

[Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation](https://istacon.org/) started as a QA conference
several years ago but it has broaden the range of acceptable topics to include
development, devops and agile. I was at the first two editions and then didn't attend
for a while until [last year]({filename}2016-11-30-ista-gtac.markdown) when I
really liked it. The event is entirely in English with lots of foreign speakers.

Recently I've been working on something I call "Regression Test Monitoring" and my
intention is to present this at ISTA 2017 so stay tuned.

**UPDATE:** I didn't manage to collect enough information on the
*Regression Test Monitoring* topic but have made two other proposals.




Thanks for reading and see you around!
