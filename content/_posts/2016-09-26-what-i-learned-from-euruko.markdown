As my frequent readers may know I try to summarize all the conferences
and events I go to. This year's EuRuKo inspired me to take a different
approach and instead of quickly summarizing the event I will try to
highlight what I have learned from it! My intention is to use this as a
tool to improve my skills and the work I do. It will probably be a long
post so here we go.

Let me say that I don't consider myself a Ruby developer although I do
write a small amount of Ruby code. I also don't really consider myself a
developer although I have a formal degree in software engineering and do
my fair share of open source contributions.

Being different and thinking differently has always been helpful to me in
Quality Assurance and this time was no exception. Attending a conference
I knew nothing about and meeting with people whose job is totally different
than mine turned out to be my greatest experience on the conference circuit
this year.

Lesson 1
--------

**Get out of the comfort zone, meet new
people, exchange ideas and learn!** The very fact that I am writing this post
not following my usual summary style proves this is working.


Very early during the event I started to notice a recurring theme which grew
stronger by the minute. The Ruby community is very open and inclusive to newcomers
and they seem to be doing a very good job about on-boarding everyone who wants to
learn. I already wrote about Ivan Nemitchenko's
[experience of organizing remote internships]({filename}2016-09-25-internship-lessons.markdown)
and there are also the Rails Girls local communities, the 
[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) (didn't know about it)
and the various local Ruby communities who pitched their cities to host the next
EuRuKo. I really loved this feeling of community. In the broader Linux, Python and
QA world I have not seen this being so pronounced.

Lesson 2
--------

**Open up (the open source) community even more. Make it easier for newcomers to join!
Treat them as human and don't expect them to be like yourself. Do teach and mentor
both to help newcomers but also to help yourself become better!**

This is mostly on par with my community work but I think I can do better. I will take
the time to evaluate what I've been doing in the past and identify areas for improvements.
I also encourage my readers and students to send me feedback as well.


I've also learned that junior developers can make meaningful
contributions to production grade code when they are given the appropriate set of tasks
and guidance. Stephanie Nemeth argued that companies should hire (more) enthusiastic
career changers as junior developers because they have very strong motivation for
success.


Lesson 3
--------

**Re-evaluate how we look at junior developers, especially how we examine and hire them
and how we on-board them**.


Both lessons 2 and 3 are valid in the open source world and even more so in the
corporate world.


I also liked the fact that some of the lightning talks were given by people who
had no previous experience in Ruby. @TeamJoda2016 talked about what they did and
learn throughout the summer and really cracked the room with their
"oh and btw we are looking for a job" as their final slide!


Lesson 4
--------

**If you are new/inexperienced at something don't be afraid to try it out. Give it
the best you've got and see how it goes. Worst case .... well nothing bad really happens,
best case you end up doing the best job in your life.** That's also been my
[personal experience with software testing]({filename}2014-02-19-7-years-1400-bugs-red-hat-qa.markdown).


Carina C. Zona's *Consequences Of An Insightful Algorithm*
(old video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheE6udjfGI&list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&index=28))
dealt with the ethical
responsibilities of us as developers and this is becoming more common with deep learning neural networks.

Lesson 5
--------
**We’re able to extract remarkably precise
intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn’t
consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there?**


Krissy's *The HTT(Pancake) Request* made a great analogy of consuming APIs with
your customer experience when visiting a restaurant.

Lesson 6
--------

**Design APIs (software in general) as if that was a physical product where your
customers happiness matters**. We see this all the time in our daily jobs and we're
guilty of doing it as well. Btw at the moment I'm in the middle of huge refactoring
of [django-chartit](https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit) which breaks all
backwards compatibility. I guess I will have to re-evaluate my design and approach.

By accident I've made good friends with Alex Georgiev and the folks at Fyber.
I liked the fact that at the conference they had couple of people
working in QA and we managed to have a nice talk about QA vs developers and the transformation
between the two. That also touched on the bigger subject of testers not being able to
code and testers not being available for hire.

Lesson 7
--------

**Driving people to improve their skills (learn to code, write tests, etc) is possible
but needs to come from management, needs clear direction and also a little bit of peer pressure.**

After all isn't that what an agile team is supposed to be ?


Now being the able to code, not entirely Ruby ignorant QA guy that I am I was
immediately offered several positions in London and Berlin (and no I'm still staying
in Sofia). As it turned out good QA engineers with good development skills are
in greater demand than developers not only in Sofia but all around the world!


Lesson 8
--------

**Fellow QA guys, please do learn to program. Dear developers, please try thinking
more like a tester the next time you write code** (me included).


Hiring a barista and furnishing your company stand with the best coffee machine
you can afford while having an ugly hand written sign saying "MAIN CONFERENCE COFFEE ->"
is a marketing stunt that I really love. I'm not sure how well that worked for their
hiring but it got them visibility. I'm definitely stealing this one!

Lesson 9
--------

**Conference coffee sucks. Provide better one and developers will queue at your stand.
To a greater extent - research your target and their needs and provide a product
that solves their problem.**


What we gave back

My personal contribution back was telling Yammer and Deliveroo about mutation
testing and pointing them to the right tools and videos on the subject. I wish
them good luck and happy testing.

**NOTE:** I will be speaking about mutation testing at
several different events in Bulgaria in the next 2 months so make sure to find
me if you want to chat.
