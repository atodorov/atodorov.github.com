by Timothy Ferriss is one of my all time favorite books.
The basic idea is to ditch the traditional working environment
and work less utilizing more automation.

{% blockquote MARK TWAIN %}
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
{% endblockquote %}

The book starts with a story about the Tango World Championship semifinals in
Argentina and poses the question 
*“What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left my job and the U.S. over a year ago?”*
Can you answer this? Keep reading!

Step 1: Definition
------------------

Tim defines two groups of people. The Deferrers, those who save it all for the
end only to find that life has passed them by and the New Rich.

{% blockquote %}
* The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement
  to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the time, which frees him to
  practice cross-country skiing and take road trips with his family two weeks per
  month.

* The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers and projects,
  outsources all operations entirely, and travels the world collecting rare
  documents, all while working remotely on a website to showcase her own
  illustration work.

* The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to establish an online
  video rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche
  of Blu-ray aficionados, a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work
  full-time as an animal rights lobbyist.
{% endblockquote %}

The possibilities are endless. What defines the New Rich is their unrestricted mobility
and availability of free time! Money alone doesn't count anymore. Its practical value is
multiplied by the *what*, *when*, *where* and with *whom* you do what you do.

From that point of view earning less money but spending far less time on that is
much more powerful than working 80 hours per week for a million dollars.

Step 2: Elimination
-------------------

{% blockquote BRUCE LEE %}
One does not accumulate but eliminate.
It is not daily increase but daily decrease.
The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity.
{% endblockquote %}


In this chapter Tim talks about developing selective ignorance of information,
the 80-20 [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle),
gives tips for faster reading and battling interruption like checking your e-mail
and smart phone.

Step 3: Automation
------------------

Outsourcing and technical automation are the keys here but there is more.
Tim talks about income autopilot - designing your income sources in such a way
so that they don't consume much of your time and continue to produce income
even after the initial time investment.

Think about the following: working a 9-to-5 job yields an income only during
office hours. Having written a book yields income whenever a copy is sold, which
is while you're asleep and long after the initial time investment required to
write the book.

Then you can diversify your income streams and voila - you're making money
automatically :)

Tim also refers to the business management side of things. Why become the
manager when you can be the owner of the business ? It's kind of hard to
let virtual assistants run your business and resolve issues for you but that
frees up your time which is more valuable.

In between he also mentions why as a business you should keep prices high!
Counter intuitive, isn't it? 

This is easier said than done but I've been working on it for the last couple
of years and its starting to take shape nicely so there's truth to it.



Step 4: Liberation
------------------

This is the chapter which helps you escape the 9-5 office hours through some
interesting techniques. This is not only for freelancers like myself but also
for the regular employee. One of the principles is to ask for forgiveness,
not a permission (which will be denied anyway).


Another one boils down to:

* Increase company investment into you so that the loss is greater if you quit,
e.g. corporate training;
* Prove increased output offsite - call in sick Tuesday to Thursday but continue
working. Produce more and leave some sort of digital trail, emails, etc;
* Prepare the quantifiable business benefit - you need to present remote working
as a good business decision and not a personal perk, for example you've managed to
bill more hours to your company's customers. As explanation use removal of commute
and fewer distractions from the office noise;
* Propose a revocable trial period - plan everything that will be said but play it
cool and casual. You want to avoid the impression that remote working will be something
permanent (for now). Find a relaxed afternoon and give it a shot!
* Expand remote time by making sure you're most productive on your days out of the
office and if need be lower the productivity inside the office a bit. Then give it
a shot for a longer trial period or more days working remotely;


There's also another one called the hourglass approach, so named because you use a
long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote agreement and then negotiate
back up to full-time out of the office.

I personally had it easier in terms of remote working. Before I became a contractor
I've been working with folks in the US to whom it doesn't really matter whether I was
based in Czech Republic or in Bulgaria. Also I've been sick at that time and had an
important project to manage which all just played nicely in proving that I
can be productive in any location.



Then comes one of my favorite sections *Killing Your Job*. Boy you just have to read
this. Lots of people need to read this! Everything you are afraid of and keeps you from
quitting your job is total bulshit. There are always options. It might be emotionally
difficult, but you won’t starve!


Extended edition
-----------------

This extended edition of the book completes with blog articles and bonus sections
like *Killing Your BlackBerry*.

{% blockquote ANDREW, self-employed in the UK %}
I’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. 
Been doing this for seven years. Prior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W
(translate: work for work’s sake)
...
Crunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately
began taking Mondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend.
Tuesday to Friday I work 11 A.M.–4 P.M. (20 hours per week).
...
I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that
50% of the 80% was pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone
on my payroll.
...
I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync”.
Now it’s on a Tues–Fri, 11 A.M.–4 P.M. schedule.
...
My e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending
me meaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me.
