Last month I was asked to review stickers from
[UnixStickers](https://www.unixstickers.com/). In return I would receive
some of them.
I've made them a counter offer - they send me stickers and I give them to students
attending my
[QA-and-Automation-101](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101)
course.

Yesterday I gave away everything I was sent, some of which you can see on the
picture above. All stickers were gone in minutes. The ones that were left were
the yellow JS ones and the Fedora infinity logo. It turned out most students are
not familiar with Fedora but otherwise liked the stickers.

If you haven't come across [UnixStickers](https://www.unixstickers.com/) until
now I definitely recommend it. It is a great source to purchase stickers, mugs
and T-shirts branded with your favorite open source project(s). In return some
of the money is donated back to the community to support their open source work.
A great business model in my opinion.
