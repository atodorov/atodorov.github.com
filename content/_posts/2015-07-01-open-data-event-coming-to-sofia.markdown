[Open Data and Intelligent Government](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/17565601186)
is the name of upcoming event organized by [Sofia Tech Park](http://sofiatech.bg/en/)
on July 14th.

The (preliminary) topics for this event are:

* Government vision for opening data;
* Presentation of national platform for open data;
* Legal aspects of open data;
* Presentation of [Bulgarian open data portal](http://opendata.government.bg/);
* Europe and open data;
* Open, coordinated e-government for citizens and business;
* What has already been done by municipalities in Bulgaria;
* Strategy of Sofia municipality for open data;
* Upcoming open data programming contest organized by Sofia municipality.

I will also be participating in this event by covering two topics I'm close to:

* Entrepreneurship and open data - sharing my limited experience with Difio
and processing open data; 
* Technical tips for successful open data hackathon - sharing my observations as
a mentor at [HackFMI](http://hackfmi.com) and giving some recommendations which will
help the alleged open data contest make a difference not being just another dull event
organized by governmental agencies.

So far other confirmed speakers are Rado from [HackBulgaria](http://hackbulgaria.com)/
[HackFMI](http://hackfmi.com) and [Obshtestvo.bg](https://www.obshtestvo.bg/) which are
working in the field of open government and open data.

I'm also in touch with the event organizers and helping a little bit with the program.
If you're interested in speaking please get in touch with me ASAP.
