![Messenger typo](/images/messenger_typo.png "Messenger typo")

There's a typo in the Bulgarian translation of Messenger.com.
It is highlighted by the red dot on the picture.

*hunspell* easily catches it so either Facebook doesn't run their
translations through a spell checker or their spell checker is
borked.
