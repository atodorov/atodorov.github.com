                    Howto: Django Forms with Dynamic Fields
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Last week at <a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI 3.0</a> one team had to display a form
which presented multiple choice selection for filtering, where the filter keys
are read from the database. They've solved the problem by simply building up the
HTML required inside the view. I was wondering if this can be done with forms.</p>

<p>So if we were to query all names from the database then we could build up the
class by adding a BooleanField using the object primary key as the name.</p>

                <p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi_beer.jpg" alt="HackFMI" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></p>
<p>The fourth <a href="http://hackfmi.com/hackfmi3-winners/">HackFMI</a>,
now traditional, hackathon was held this weekend.
It is over and I still can't wrap my head around what happened during these 3 nights. Here's
bits of code, beer, energy drinks and fun as I saw it.</p>
<p>A big thanks goes to Lilly and Misha who were running around like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL6e3co4Qqc">robots</a> managing the day-to-day activities.
Kudos to the rest of the team as well because they've established HackFMI as a tradition
and people already ask when is going to be the next event.</p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>This year the topic was <em>Hack for charity</em> and immediate goal of raising money for
a sick kid. Most of the teams got to work to meet these goals. Only a few had worked
on slightly different charity (broadly defined) ideas.</p>
<p>My favorite two apps were Blago-darenie and SMShelp although they were not
developed with Django.</p>
<p><a href="http://blago-darenie.outernetnotes.com/">Blago-darenie</a> is a simple WordPress
site listing donation campaigns. Instead of directly donating money one needs to
promise something (an action, an object, etc) and put a price tag on it. When the
promise is claimed the two parties donate the money to that particular campaign
and exchange the promised goods or services. I've promised to cook dinner
involving tasty meatballs from horse meat and serve one of my wine bottles to whoever
decides to donate 25 EUR. (disclaimer: I'm a good cook and love wine more than code).</p>
<p><a href="http://ganev.bg/project-8/">SMShelp</a> is an aggregator of donation campaigns via SMS
which are very popular in the country but lack a central repository for all of them.
A simple web site, live Android app and wonderful design secured the team the first place!
BTW Team 8 was <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/">Adrian and Vihren</a>
who took part in all previous editions as well.</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>I'm glad both organizers and teams had listened to some of my feedback but there are
still things to improve. The most obvious one was that a quick communication channel
to all the teams is needed. Facebook and email just didn't cut it.</p>
<p>I already have couple of quick ideas involving Django and Twilio's cloud services.
Let me take a few more days to get it clear before going any further.</p>
<h2>/me</h2>
<p>I found myself mentoring as much as I could helping folks with Django or just
with general ideal or concepts, serving cake provided by <a href="http://www.chaosgroup.com">Chaos Group</a>
and opening stacks of energy drinks, going door to door and letting teams know deployment and presentation
details for the last day.</p>
<p>What surprised me a bit was that there were many new teams (some involving previous contestants)
who were very diverse in their technological background. This presented a challenge to
some of them as they had to use a technology which nobody on the team knew very well
and had to make a working app with that. One team even changed from Python to PHP in the
middle of day 2.</p>
<p>On Sunday I was pretty much helping the HackFMI team with whatever I can,
checking on my favorite teams from time to time and giving access to cloud servers
left and right to people who needed them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I missed the Grand Finale due to unexpected hardware problems involving
big iron and 150 litters of loose water :(. See you next time!</p>

                    Spoiler: How to Open Source Existing Proprietary Code in 10 Steps
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>We've heard about companies opening up their proprietary software products,
this is hardly news nowadays. But have you wondered what it is like to migrate
production software from closed to open source? I would like to share my own
experience about going open source as seen from behind the keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> was recently open sourced and the steps to go through
were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify - remove everything that can be deleted</li>
<li>Create self contained modules aka re-organize the file structure</li>
<li>Separate internal from external modules</li>
<li>Refactor the existing code</li>
<li>Select license and update copyright</li>
<li>Update 3rd party dependencies to latest versions and add requirements.txt</li>
<li>Add README and verbose settings example</li>
<li>Split difio/ into its own git repository</li>
<li>Test stand alone deployments on fresh environment</li>
<li>Announce</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you want to know more? Use the comments and tell me what exactly!
I'm writing a longer version of this article so stay tuned!</p>

                    Beware of Django default Model Field Option When Using datetime.now()
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Beware if you are using code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now())
</pre></div>


<p>i.e. passing a function return value as the default option for a model field in Django.
In some cases the value will be calculated once when the application starts or
the module is imported and will not be updated later. The most common scenario
is DateTime fields which default to now(). The correct way is to use a callable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now)
</pre></div>


<p>I've hit this issue on a low volume application which uses cron to collect its own
metrics by calling an internal URL. The app was running as WSGI app and I wondered
why I got records with duplicate dates in the DB. A more detailed (correct) example follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">_strftime</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;%Y-%m-</span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Metrics</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">IntegerField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db_index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FloatField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">added_on</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db_index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">added_on_as_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">_strftime</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> also had the same bug but didn't exhibit the problem
because all objects with default date-time values were created on the backend nodes
which get updated and restarted very often.</p>

                    Positive Biological Effects of Open Source on Humans
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y">talk by Simon Sinek</a>
about leadership. He talks about Endorphins, Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin
and how they make us feel and act a particular way. Then I though - maybe that's why working
in the open source field always felt great and natural to me. Maybe we humans
are programmed to follow the open source way!</p>
<p>This article scratches the surface where body chemistry and open source intersect.
I hope it will help both volunteers and community managers get an insight of the
driving forces in our bodies, how they relate to the open source world and promt
further exploration. By seeking to better understand the positive effects and avoid
the negative ones we can become better contributors and leaders which ultimately 
helps our communities.</p>
<h2>Endorphins</h2>
<p>Endorphins stand for endurance. Their job is to mask physical pain and it has been
suggested to have evolutionary roots based on the theory that they helped with the
survival of early humans. Athletes experience so called Runner's high.</p>
<p>In the open source world one may work on a feature or task for hours and hours
without feeling exhausted. The task itself keeps you going and excited.
This is endorphins going through your brain.</p>
<p>In software one may experience an endorphin rush during public release days for example. For large
projects like Fedora the release process includes many steps and may take several hours.
During all that time the release engineer is usually available regardless of their native
time zone.</p>
<p>Effects of endorphins could potentially increase the likelihood of injury or extreme exhaustion,
as pain sensation could be more easily ignored. Work and rest cycles need to be properly balanced.</p>
<h2>Dopamine</h2>
<p>This is the feeling when we achieve our goals or found something we were looking for.
Dopamine helps us get things done! This is why we're told to write down our goals and then
cross them off. It makes people more productive.</p>
<p>Getting dopamine through open source is very easy - all you need to do is fix a bug,
then another one, and another one, and another one ... After every task you complete the body
gets a small dopamine fix. "Release early, release often ..." and you get your fix :). </p>
<p>Dopamine however is highly addictive and destructive if unbalanced. It has the same negative
effects as any other addiction - alcohol, drugs, etc. Be aware of that and don't fall for the
performance trap.</p>
<p>Endorphins and Dopamine are so called selfish chemicals. You can get them without external help.
The next two are the social chemicals.</p>
<h2>Serotonin</h2>
<p>It is responsible for feelings of pride and status and assessing social rank.
Serotonin is produced when you are recognized for achievements by the open source community
or credited by somebody (e.g. Johnny Bravo mentioned a great idea on IRC today).</p>
<p>As a contributor one may work on items which will help you get recognition but ultimately this
is not for you to decide. However practice shows that credit and recognition are relatively easy
to get in the open source world provided one has contributed to make the project and the
community better in some sort.</p>
<p>In software this is being granted commit rights to a repository, being in the top spot of
some metrics, having your blog read by other members or simply people asking for help or 
what you think about some topic.</p>
<p>Serotonin is considered the leadership chemical. As one becomes a leader recognized by the
community there's a catch - the more your status goes up the more work you have to
do. The more people recognize you as the leader the more they expect you to sacrifice yourself
in case it all goes Pete Tong. If you are not ready to step up find a more suitable place in
the community instead.</p>
<h2>Oxytocin</h2>
<p>Oxytocin is responsible for feelings of love, trust and friendship. It makes us feel safe.
It is also very good for the body because it makes us healthier, boosts our
immune system, increases ability to solve problems and increases creativity.</p>
<p>One way to get Oxytocin is by physical touch - e.g. a hand shake. This is probably one of
the reasons beer gatherings are so popular among open source developers.
Working digitally we need a way to
reinforce human bonds in our communities. Knowing the person on the other end of the wire
ultimately makes us feel safer. If you are in open source just go for that conference or a
local beer bash you wanted to go - it is good for you (but don't get drunk).</p>
<p>Another way to get Oxytocin is by performing or witnessing acts of human generosity. 
This comes natural in open source world where people give up their free time and energy to work towards
a shared goal. Just by working in an open source environment you get all that goodness for you.</p>
<p>The best thing about Oxytocin is that it is not addictive and slowly builds up in the body. 
The bad side is that it takes a while to build up. This is why you have to stay a little longer
in open source before it starts feeling safe and welcoming.</p>
<h2>Cortisol</h2>
<p>The last chemical Simon talks about is Cortisol. It is bad, very bad. It will crash your body.
Cortisol means stress. It is designed to keep humans (and animals) alive by hyper tuning
our senses in case of danger. Trouble is you are not supposed to have it in your body for
long periods of time because it shuts down non-essential systems to deliver that extra energy.</p>
<p>Luckily most open source projects are not stressful and I think can be considered a safe place
to work in. In the end one can always shift to another role or move to another project if it
becomes too pressing.</p>
<p>By committing
to help another member or perform service to the community our bodies get all the good
stuff and beat the negative. Service to a community is exactly what open source does!
See, humans are programmed to live and work the open source way! </p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    I Need an App to Connect With My Facebook Page Fans
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>The biggest problem of Facebook is the sheer number of news items 
which are filtered out if users are not actively engaged with them.
For a page admin/business owner this means Facebook makes a poor job at reaching
to my fans and potential customers unless I keep paying them money!
I need two basic features to solve this problem. </p>
<h2>Contact All Users App aka Newsletter</h2>
<p>I need to be able to message my fan base like a newsletter with the following
requirements in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users have already liked the page, don't make them sign-up or follow anything else;</li>
<li>Preferably use Facebook messages instead of email;</li>
<li>Let them unsubscribe from the newsletter without going away/blocking the page;</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one is straight forward - I've already put some money in promoting my page
and collecting fans. No need for more hurdles to get started. For reference out of 500
users none has actually subscribed to the page. This gives you an idea how much they
will subscribe to newsletters and such. They click LIKE and forget about it.</p>
<p>The second one is dependent on the target audience. I have the feeling that my target
audience is reading Facebook messages much more than email.</p>
<p>My primary use case of this will be to send new offers and validation queries to the
target audience in order to tailor the content and business to them.</p>
<h2>Weekly Digest App</h2>
<p>Looking at my Facebook page stats it is clear that only promoted content gets a higher reach.
This includes both content paid for and content posted during periods where the page itself
had an active advertisement.</p>
<p>This is no coincidence I think. When the page is promoted to new audience they will get around
the available tabs, explore and like pictures and scroll down to see some of the older content.
Assuming the person becomes a page fan they will fall into the previously described trap (content filter)
and not see much of the page activity.</p>
<p>I need an application which will aggregate the content from the last week and send it to
everyone. This app needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to configure digest period/cut-off days and when to send the digest;</li>
<li>Allow users to unsubscribe or alter their digest preferences;</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary use case is to alert users of content which they may have missed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonus feature: exclude content which was seen by the specific person or they somehow reacted to it;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to next</h2>
<p>I am actively looking for such kinds of apps but haven't found any yet. When time allows I will
be looking at the Facebook API to see if this is at all possible to implement. </p>
<p>Any suggestions ? </p>

                    SMS PIN Verification with Twilio and Django
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>This is a quick example of SMS PIN verification using Twilio cloud services and
Django which I did for a small site recently.</p>
<p><img alt="SMS PIN form" src="/images/sms_pin.png" title="SMS PIN form" /></p>
<p>The page template contains the following HTML snippet</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;mobile_number&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;mobile_number&quot;</span> <span class="na">placeholder=</span><span class="s">&quot;111-111-1111&quot;</span> <span class="na">required</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

</pre></div>


<p>and a JavaScript function utilizing jQuery:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">send_pin</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">({</span>

                <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;PIN sent via SMS!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="p">})</span>
            <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">jqXHR</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">textStatus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">errorThrown</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then create the following views in Django:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">_get_pin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>PINs are only numeric and are stored in the CACHE instead of the database which
I think is simpler and less expensive in terms of I/O operations.</p>

                <p>Recently I wrote about <a href="/blog/2014/03/04/how-do-you-test-fonts/">testing fonts</a>.
I finally managed to get an answer from the authors of <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your approach for testing Fonts-TLWG?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not automated test. What it does is generate PDF with sample
texts at several sizes (the waterfall), pangrams, and glyph table.
It needs human eyes to investigate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of problems is your test suite designed for ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaping</li>
<li>Glyph coverage</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>We also make use of fontforge features to make spotting errors
easier, such as
- Show extremas
- Show almost vertical/horizontal lines/curves</p>

                    Reducing AWS Cloud Costs - Real Money Example
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/effective-february-2014/">Last month</a> Amazon
reduced by 50% prices for EBS storage. This, combined with 
<a href="/blog/2014/02/07/aws-tip-shrinking-ebs-root-volume-size/">shrinking EBS root volume size</a> and
<a href="/blog/2014/02/10/moving-tmp-from-ebs-to-instance-storage/">moving /tmp to instance storage</a>
allowed me to reduce EBS related costs behind <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> by around 50%.
Following are the real figures from my AWS Bill.</p>
<p>EBS costs for Difio were gradually rising up with every new node added to the cluster and
increased package processing (resulting in more I/O):</p>
<ul>
<li>November 2013 - $7.38</li>
<li>December 2013 - $10.55</li>
<li>January 2014 - $11.97</li>
</ul>
<p>January 2014:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>EBS
$0.095 per GB-Month of snapshot data stored     9.052 GB-Mo     $0.86
$0.10  per GB-month of provisioned storage      101.656 GB-Mo  $10.17
$0.10  per 1 million I/O requests               9,405,243 IOs   $0.94
                                                        Total: $11.97
</pre></div>


<p>In February there was one new system added to process additional requests
(cluster nodes run as spot instances) and an increased number of temporary
instances (although I haven't counted them) while I was restructuring AMI
internals to accommodate the <a href="https://github.com/difio/difio">open source</a>
version of Difio. My assumption (based on historical data) is this would
have driven the costs up in the region of $15 per month only for EBS.</p>
<p>After implementing the stated minimal improvements and having Amazon reduced the prices by
half the bill looks like this:</p>
<p>February 2014:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>EBS
$0.095 per GB-Month of snapshot data stored     8.668 GB-Mo     $0.82
$0.05  per GB-month of provisioned storage      58.012 GB-Mo    $2.90
$0.05  per 1 million I/O requests               5,704,482 IOs   $0.29
                                                        Total:  $4.01
</pre></div>


<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p><em>Snapshot data stored</em> is the volume of snapshots (AMIs, backups, etc) which
I have. This is fairly constant.</p>
<p><em>Provisioned storage</em> is the volume of EBS storage provisioned for running
instances (e.g. root file system, data partitions, etc.). This was reduced
mainly because of shrinking the root volumes. (Previously I've used larger
root volumes for a bigger /tmp).</p>
<p><em>I/O requests</em> is the number of I/O requests associated with your EBS volumes.
As far as I understand Amazon doesn't charge for I/O related to ephemeral storage.
Moving /tmp from EBS to instance storage is the reason this was reduced roughly by half.</p>
<h2>Where To Next</h2>
<p>I've reduced the root volumes back to the 8GB defaults but this has still room for
improvement b/c the AMI is quite minimal. This will bring the largest improvements.
Another thing is the still relatively high I/O rate that touches EBS volumes.
I haven't investigated where this comes from though.</p>

                    How do You Test Fonts
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><a href="/blog/2014/03/03/last-week-in-fedora-qa/">Previously</a> I mentioned about testing
fonts but didn't have any idea how this is done. Authors
Khaled Hosny of <a href="http://www.amirifont.org/">Amiri Font</a> and Steve White of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">GNU FreeFont</a> provided valuable insight
and material for further reading. I've asked them:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your approach for testing ?</li>
<li>What kind of problems is your test suite designed for ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently my test suite consists of text strings (or lists of code
points) and expected output glyph sequences and then use HarfBuzz
(through its hb-shape command line tool) to check that the fonts always
output the expected sequence of glyphs, sometimes with the expected
positioning as well. Amiri is a complex font that have many glyph
substitution and positioning rules, so the test suite is designed to
make sure those rules are always executed correctly to catch regressions
in the font (or in HarfBuzz, which sometimes happens since the things I
do in my fonts are not always that common).</p>
<p>I think Lohit project do similar testing for their fonts, and HarfBuzz
itself has a similar test suite with a bunch of nice scripts (though
they are not installed when building HarfBuzz, yet[1]).</p>
<p>Recently I added more kinds of tests, namely checking that OTS[2]
sanitizes the fonts successfully as this is important for using them on
the web, and a test for a common mistakes I made in my feature files
that result in unexpected blank glyphs in the fonts.</p>

</ol>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is complicated.  I'll do what I can to answer.</p>
<p>First, the FontForge application has a "verification" function which
can be run from a script, and which identifies numerous technical
problems.</p>
<p>FontForge also has a "Find Problems" function that I run by hand.</p>
<p>The monospaced face has special restrictions, first that all glyphs of
non-zero width must be of the same width, and second, that all glyphs
lie within the vertical bounds of the font.</p>
<p>Beside this, I have several other scripts that check for a few things
that FontForge doesn't (duplicate names, that glyph slots agree with
Unicode code within Unicode character blocks).</p>
<p>Several tests scripts have yet to be uploaded to the version control
system -- because I'm unsure of them.</p>
<p>There is a more complicated check of TrueType tables, which attempts
to find cases of tables that have been "shadowed" by the
script/language specification of another table.  This is helpful, but
works imperfectly.</p>
<p>ALL THAT SAID,</p>
<p>In the end, every script used in the font has to be visually checked.
This process takes me weeks, and there's nothing systematic about it,
except that I look at printout of documents in each language to see if
things have gone awry.</p>
<p>For a few documents in a few languages, I have images of how text
<em>should</em> look, and can compare that visually (especially important for
complex scripts.)</p>
<p>A few years back, somebody wrote a clever script that generated images
of text and compared them pixel-by-pixel.  This was a great idea, and
I wish I could use it more effectively, but the problem was that it
was much too sensitive.  A small change to the font (e.g. PostScript
parameters) would cause a small but global change in the rendering.
Also the rendering could vary from one version of the rendering
software to another.  So I don't use this anymore.</p>
<p>That's all I can think of right now.</p>
<p>In fact, testing has been a big problem in getting releases out.  In
the past, each release has taken at least two weeks to test, and then
another week to fix and bundle...if I was lucky.  And for the past
couple of years, I just haven't been able to justify the time
expenditure.  (Besides this, there are still a few serious problems
with the fonts--once again, a matter of time.)</p>
<p>Have a look at the bugs pages, to get an idea of work being done.</p>
<p><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=freefont">http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=freefont</a></p>
<p>Steve White, GNU FreeFont</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if ImageMagic or PIL can help solve the rendering and compare
problem Steve is talking about. They can definitely be used for
<a href="/blog/2013/05/17/linux-and-python-tools-to-compare-images/">image comparison</a>
so maybe coupled with some rendering library it's worth a quick try.</p>

                    Last Week in Fedora QA
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Here are some highlights from the past week discussions in Fedora which I found
interesting or participated in.</p>
<h2>Call to Action: Improving Overall Test Coverage in Fedora</h2>
<p>I can not stress enough how important it is to further
<a href="/blog/2014/02/28/action-improving-test-coverage-in-fedora/">improve test coverage in Fedora</a>!
You can help too. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join upstream and create a test suite for a package you find interesting;</li>
<li>Provide patches - <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-February/196035.html">first patch</a>
came in less than 30 minutes of initial announcement :);</li>
<li>Review packages in the wiki and help identify false negatives;</li>
<li>Forward to people who may be interested to work on these items;</li>
<li>Share and promote in your local open source and developer communities;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Auto BuildRequires</h2>
<p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/auto-buildrequires/">Auto-BuildRequires</a>
is a simple set of scripts which compliments <code>rpmbuild</code> by
automatically suggesting BuildRequires lines for the just built package.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have this integrated into Koji and/or
continuous integration environment and compare the output between every two
consecutive builds (iow older and newer package versions). It sounds like a
good way to identify newly added or removed dependencies and update the package
specs accordingly.</p>
<h2>How To Test Fonts Packages</h2>
<p>This is exactly what 
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-February/120570.html">Christopher Meng asked</a>
and frankly I have no idea. </p>
<p>I've come across a few fonts packages (<em>amiri-fonts</em>, <em>gnu-free-fonts</em> and <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>)
which seem to have some sort of test suites but I don't know how they work or
what type of problems they test for. On top of that all three have a different
way of doing things (e.g. not using a standardized test framework or a variation of such).</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on this once I manage to get more info from upstream developers.</p>
<h2>Is URL Field in RPM Useless</h2>
<p>So is it? Opinions here differ from totally useless to "don't remove it, I need it".
However I run a small test and from 2574 RPMs on the source DVD there is around 
40% of "something different than HTTP 200 OK". This means <strong>40% potentially broken URLs</strong>!</p>
<p>The majority are responses in the 3XX range and only less than 10% are 
actual errors (4XX, 5XX, missing URLs or connection errors).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this can be removed from <code>rpm</code> altogether.
I don't think it will happen soon but if we don't use it why have it there? </p>
<p>My script for the test is
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/test-rpm-url-field.sh">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Around Christmas 2013
<a href="/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/">I said</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it looks like on average 30% of the packages execute their test suites at
build time in the %check section and less than 35% have test suites at all!
There’s definitely room for improvement and I plan to focus on this during 2014!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've recently started working on this goal by first identifying potential offending
packages and discussing the idea on Fedora's
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-February/thread.html">devel</a>,

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is a Django based service which uses a profile
model to provide site-specific, per-user information.
In the process of <a href="https://github.com/difio/difio">open sourcing Difio</a> its core
functionality becomes available as a Django app. The trouble is that the 
<code>UserProfile</code> model contains site-specific and proprietary data which doesn't
make sense to the public nor I want to release it.</p>
<p>The solution is to have a <code>MockProfile</code> model and work with
that by default while <a href="http://www.dif.io">www.dif.io</a> and other implementations
override it as needed.
<strong>How do you do that without creating useless table and records in the database
but still have the profiles created automatically for every user?</strong></p>
<p>It turns out the solution is quite simple. See my comments inside the code below.</p>

<p>In Difio core the user profile is always used like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>profile = request.user.get_profile()

<p>and by default</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = &quot;difio.MockProfile&quot;

                    Skip or Render Specific Blocks from Jinja2 Templates
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I wasn't able to find detailed information on how to skip rendering
or only render specific blocks from Jinja2 templates so here's my solution.
Hopefully you find it useful too.</p>
<p>With below template I want to be able to render <strong>only</strong> <em>kernel_options</em> block
as a single line and then render the rest of the template <strong>excluding</strong> <em>kernel_options</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><span class="filename">base.j2</span><pre><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">kernel_options</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">console=tty0</span>
<span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">debug</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">        debug=1</span>
<span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="nv">kernel_options</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>

<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">OS_MAJOR</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">key --skip</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>

<span class="x">%packages</span>
<span class="x">@base</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">OS_MAJOR</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">%end</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>To render a particular block you have to use the low level Jinja API
<em><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#jinja2.Template.blocks">template.blocks</a></em>.
This will return a dict of block rendering functions which need a <em>Context</em> to work with.</p>
<p>The second part is trickier. To remove a block we have to create an extension
which will filter it out. The provided <em>SkipBlockExtension</em> class does
exactly this.</p>
<p>Last but not least - if you'd like to use both together you have to disable
caching in the <em>Environment</em> (so you get a fresh template every time), render
your blocks first, configure <em>env.skip_blocks</em> and render the entire template
without the specified blocks.</p>

            </a>
                <p>Today I celebrate my 7th year working at Red Hat's Quality Engineering department.
Here's my story!</p>
<p><img alt="Platform QE" src="/images/redhat_platform_qe.jpg" title="Platform QE" /></p>
<p>On a cold winter Friday in 2007 I left my job as a software developer in Sofia,
packed my stuff together, purchased my <a href="http://amzn.to/1hlPuyr">first laptop</a> and
on Sunday jumped the train to Brno to join the Release Test Team at Red Hat.
Little did I know what it was all about. When I was offered the position
I was on a very noisy bus and had to pick between two positions. I didn't quite understood
what were the options and just picked the second one.
Luckily everything turned out great and continues to this day.</p>
<p>I'm sharing my experience and highlighting some bugs which I've found.
Hopefully you will find this interesting and amusing. If you are a QA engineer
I urge you to take a look at <a href="http://red.ht/1gbHElQ">my public bug portfolio</a>,
dive into details, read the comments and learn as much as you can.</p>
<h2>What do I do exactly</h2>
<p>From all QE teams in Red Hat, Release Test Team is the first one and
last one to test a release. The team has both technical function and a more managerial one.
Our focus is on the core Red Hat Enterprise Linux product. 
Unfortunately I can't go into much details because this is not a public facing unit.
I will limit myself to <strong>public and/or non-sensitive information</strong>.</p>
<p>We are the first to test a new nightly build or a
snapshot of the upcoming RHEL release. If the tree is installable other teams take over
and do their magic. At the end when bits are published live we're the last to
verify that content is published where it is expected to be. In short this is
covering the work of the release engineering team which is to build a product and
publish the contents for consumption.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to Fedora although the engagement here is less demanding.</p>
<p>Personally I have been and continue to be responsible for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
family of releases. It's up to me to give the go ahead for further testing or request
a re-spin. This position
also has the power to block and delay the GA release if not happy with testing or
there is a considerable risk of failure until things are sorted out.</p>
<p>Like in other QA teams I create test plan documents, write test case scenarios,
implement test automation scripts (and sometimes tools), regularly execute said test
plans and test cases, find and report any new bugs and verify old ones are fixed. 
Most importantly make sure RHEL installs and is usable for further testing :).</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to deal with capacity planning and as RHEL 5 installation 
test lead I have to organize and manage the entire installation testing campaign
for that product.</p>
<p>My favorite testing technique is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a>.</p>
<h2>Stats and Numbers</h2>
<p>It is hard (if not impossible) to <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/qe-metrics">measure QA work</a>
with numbers alone but here are some interesting facts about my experience so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 1400 bugs filed (1390 at the time of writing);</li>
<li>Reported bugs across 32 different products. Top 3 being RHEL 6, RHEL 5 and Fedora (1000+ bugs);</li>
<li>Top 3 components for reporting bugs against: anaconda, releng, kernel;</li>
<li>Nearly 100 bugs filed in my first year 2007;</li>
<li>The 3 most productive years being 2010, 2009, 2011 (800 + bugs); </li>
<li>Filed 200 bugs/year which is about 1 bug/day considering holidays;</li>
<li>35th top bug reporter (excluding robot accounts). I was in top 10 a few years back;</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of <a href="http://red.ht/1gbHElQ">the bugs I report</a> are private so if you'd like
to know more stats just ask me and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<h2>2007</h2>
<p>My very first bug is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=231860">RHBZ #231860</a>(private)
which is about the graphical update tool Pup which used to show the wrong number of available
updates.</p>
<p>Then I've played with adding <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/">Dogtail</a> support to Anaconda.
While initially this was rejected (Fedora 6/7), it was <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Features/Dogtail">implemented</a>
few years later (Fedora 9) and then removed once again during the big Anaconda rewrite.</p>
<p>I've spent my time working extensively on RHEL 5 battling with multi-lib issues, SELinux denials and
generally making the 5 family less rough. Because I was still on-boarding I generally worked
on everything I could get my hands on and also did some work on RHEL3-U9 (latest release
before EOL) and some RHEL4-U6 testing.</p>
<p>With ia64 on RHEL3 I found a corner case
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=240782">kernel bug</a> which flooded the serial
console with messages and caused a multi-CPU system to freeze.</p>
<h2>In 2008 Time went backwards</h2>
<p>My first bug in 2008 is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428280">RHBZ #428280</a>.
glibc introduced SHA-256/512 hashes for hashing passwords with crypt but that wasn't documented.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2014-02-21</strong>
While testing 5.1 to 5.2 updates I found
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=435475">RHBZ #435475</a> - a severe
<strong>performance degradation</strong> in the package installation process. Upgrades
took almost twice as much time to complete, rising <strong>from 4 hours to 7 hours</strong>
depending on hardware and package set. This was a tough one to test and verify.
<strong>END UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>While dogfooding the 5.2 beta in March I hit
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437252">RHBZ #437252</a> - kernel: Timer ISR/0: Time went backwards.
To this date this is one of my favorite bugs with a great error message!</p>
<p>Removal of a hack in RPM led to file conflicts under <code>/usr/share/doc</code> in several packages:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448905">RHBZ #448905</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448906">RHBZ #448906</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448907">RHBZ #448907</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448909">RHBZ #448909</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448910">RHBZ #448910</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448911">RHBZ #448911</a>
which is also the first time I happen to file several bugs in a row.</p>
<p>ia64 couldn't boot with encrypted partitions -
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=464769">RHBZ #464769</a>,
RHEL 5 introduced support for ext4 - <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=465248">RHBZ #465248</a>
and I've hit a fontconfig issue during upgrades - <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=469190">RHBZ #469190</a>
which continued to resurface occasionally during the next 5 years.</p>
<p>This is the year when I took over responsibility for the general installation
testing of RHEL 5 from James Laska and will continue to do so until it reaches end-of-life!</p>
<p>I've also worked on RHEL 4, Fedora and even the OLPC project. On the testing side of things
I've participated in testing
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/TestPlans/Networking">Fedora networking on the XO</a>
hardware and worked on translation and general issues.</p>
<h2>2009 - here comes RHEL 6</h2>
<p>This year starts my 3 most productive years period. </p>
<p>The second bug reported this
year is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481338">RHBZ #481338</a> which
also mentions one of my hobbies - wrist watches. While browsing a particular
website Xorg CPU usage rose to 100%. I've seen a number of these through the years
and I'm still not sure if its Xorg or Firefox or both to blame. And I still see my
CPU usage go to 100% just like that and drain my battery. I'm open to suggestions how
to test and debug what's going on as it doesn't happen in a reproducible fashion.</p>
<p>I happened to work on RHEL 4, RHEL 5, Fedora and the upcoming RHEL 6 releases and
managed to file bugs in a row not once but twice. 
I wish I was paid per bug reported back then :).</p>
<p>The first series was about empty debuginfo packages with both empty packages which
shouldn't have existed at all
(e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500628">redhat-release</a>) 
and missing debuginfo information for binary packages
(e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500612">nmap</a>).</p>
<p>The second series is around 100 bugs which had to do with the texinfo
documentation of packages when installed with --excludedocs. The first one
is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515909">RHBZ #515909</a> and the
last one <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516014">RHBZ #516014</a>.
While this works great for bumping up your bug count it made lots of developers
unhappy and not all bugs were fixed. Still the use case is valid and these
were proper software errors. It is also the first time I've used a script to
file the bugs automatically and not by hand.</p>
<p>Near the end of the year I've started testing installation on new hardware
by the likes of Intel and AMD before they hit the market. I had the pleasure to work
with the latest chipsets and CPUs, even sometime pre-release versions and make sure
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installed and worked properly on them. I've stopped doing
this last year to free up time for other tasks.</p>
<h2>2010 - one bug a day keeps developers at bay :)</h2>
<p>My most productive year with 1+ bugs per day.</p>
<p>2010 starts with a bug about file conflicts (private one) and continues with the same
narrative throughout the year.
As a matter of fact I did a small experiment and found around <strong>50000</strong>
(you read that right, fifty thousand) potentially
conflicting files, mostly between multi-lib packages, which were being ignored by RPM
due to its multi-lib policies. However these were primarily man pages or documentation
and most of them didn't get fixed. The proper fix would have been to introduce a
-docs sub-package and split these files from the actual binaries. Fortunately the world
migrated to 64bit only and this isn't an issue anymore.</p>
<p>By that time RHEL 6 development was running at its peak capacity and there were Beta
versions available. Almost the entire year I've been working on internal RHEL 6 snapshots
and discovering the many new bugs introduced with tons of new features in the installer.
Some of the new features included better IPv6 support, dracut and KVM.</p>
<p>An interesting set of bugs from September are the rpmlint errors and warnings ones,
for example <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=634931">RHBZ #634931</a>. I just
run the most basic test tool against some packages. It generated lots of false negatives
but also revealed bugs which were fixed.</p>
<p>Although there were many bugs filed this year I don't see any particularly interesting ones.
It's been more like lots of work to improve the overall quality than exploring
edge cases and finding interesting failures. If you find a bug from this period that you
think is interesting I will comment on it.</p>
<h2>2011 - Your system may be seriously compromised</h2>
<p>This is the last year of my 3 year top cycle. </p>
<p>It starts with <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=666687">RHBZ #666687</a> -
a patch for my crappy printer-scanner-coffee maker which I've been carrying around
since <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=498228">2009</a> when I bought it.</p>
<p>I was still working primarily on RHEL 6 but helped test the latest RHEL 4 release
before it went end-of-life. The interesting thing about it was that unlike other
released RHEL4-U9 was not available on installation media but only as an update from
RHEL4-U8. This was a great experience which you happen to see
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/errata/">every 4 to 5 years</a> or so.</p>
<p>Btw I've also led the installation testing effort and RTT team through the last few
RHEL 4 releases but given the product was approaching EOL there weren't many changes
and things went smoothly.</p>
<p>A minor side activity was me playing around with
<a href="/blog/2011/03/14/usb-multi-seat-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-6/">USB Multi-seat</a>
and finding a few bugs here and there along the way.</p>
<p>Another interesting activity in 2011 was proof-reading the entire product documentation
before its release which I can now relate to the 
<a href="/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/">Testing Documentation</a>
talk at FOSDEM 2014.</p>
<p>In 2011 I've started using the cloud and most notably Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS service.
First internally as an early adopter and later externally after the product was announced
to the public. There are a few interesting bugs here but they are private and I'm not
at liberty to share although they've all been fixed since then.</p>
<p>An interesting bug with NUMA, Xen and ia64
(<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=696599">RHBZ #696599</a> - private) had
me and devel banging our heads against the wall until we figured out that on this
particular system the NUMA configuration was not suitable for running Xen virtualization.</p>
<p>Can you spot the problem here ?</p>

<p>Be honest and use the comments form to tell me what you've found. If you struggled
then see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703085">RHBZ #703085</a> and come
back again to comment. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p>What do you do when you see an error message saying: 
<strong>Your system may be seriously compromised! /usr/sbin/NetworkManager tried to load a kernel module.</strong>
This is the scariest error message I've ever seen. Luckily its just
SELinux overreacting, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704090">RHBZ #704090</a>.</p>
<h2>2012 is in the red zone</h2>
<p>While the number of reported bugs dropped significantly compared to previous
years this is the year when I've reported almost exclusively high priority and
urgent bugs, the first one being 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=771901">RHBZ #771901</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=799384">RHBZ #799384</a>(against Fedora)
is one of the rare cases when I was able to contribute
(although just by raising awareness) to localization and improved support for
Bulgarian and Cyrillic. 
The other one case was <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/11/fedora-20-gnome-3-dot-10-test-day-post-mortem/">last year</a>.
Btw I find it strange that although 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic was invented by Bulgarians</a>
we didn't (or still don't) have a native font co-maintainer.
Somebody please step up!</p>
<p>The red zone bugs continue to span till the end of the year across RHEL 5, 6 and
early cuts of RHEL 7 with a pinch of OpenShift and some internal and external test tools.</p>
<h2>In 2013 Bugzilla hit 1 million bugs</h2>
<p>The year starts with a very annoying and still not fixed bug against ABRT.
It's very frustrating when the tool which is supposed to help you file bugs
doesn't work properly, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903591">RHBZ #903591</a>.
It's a known fact that
<a href="/2012/07/13/mission-impossible-abrt-bugzilla-plugin-on-rhel6/">ABRT has problems</a>
and for this scenario I may have a 
<a href="/blog/2013/10/12/tip-installing-missing-debuginfo-packages-for-abrt/">tip</a> for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=923416">RHBZ #923416</a> - another one of these
100% CPU bugs. As I said they happen from time to time and mostly go by unfixed or
partially fixed because of their nature. Btw as I'm writing this post and have
a few tabs open in Firefox it keeps using between 15% and 20% CPU and the CPU
temperature is over 90 degrees C. And all I'm doing is writing text in the console.
Help!</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967229">RHBZ #967229</a> - a minor one but
reveals an important thing - your output (and input for that matter) methods may
be producing different results. Worth testing if your software supports more than one.</p>
<p>This year I did some odd jobs working on several of Red Hat's layered products mainly
Developer Toolset. It wasn't a tough job and was a refreshing break away from the mundane
installation testing.</p>
<p>While I stopped working actively on the various RHEL families which are under development
or still supported I happened to be one of top 10 bug reporters for high/urgent priority bugs
for RHEL 7. In appreciation Red Hat sent me lots of corporate gifts and the Platform QE hoodie
pictured at the top of the page. Many thanks!</p>
<p>In the summer Red Hat's 
<a href="/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-bugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">Bugzilla hit One Million bugs</a>.
The closest I come to this milestone is
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999941">RHBZ #999941</a>.</p>
<p>I finally managed to transfer most of my responsibilities to co-workers and joined
the Fedora QA team as a part-time contributor. I had some highs and lows with
<a href="/blog/2013/10/07/fedora-20-virtualization-and-gnome-test-days-at-init-lab-this-week/">Fedora test days in Sofia</a>
as well. Good thing is I scored another 15 bugs across the
<a href="/blog/2013/10/08/fedora-20-virtualization-test-day-post-mortem/">virtualization stack</a>
and <a href="/blog/2013/10/11/fedora-20-gnome-3-dot-10-test-day-post-mortem/">GNOME 3.10</a>.</p>
<p>The year wraps up with another series of identical bugs,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024729">RHBZ #1024729</a> and
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1025289">RHBZ #1025289</a> for example.
As it <a href="/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/">turned out</a>
lots of packages don't have any test suites at all and those
which do don't always execute them automatically in %check. I've promised myself
to improve this but still haven't had time to work on it. Hopefully by
March I will have something in the works.</p>
<h2>2014 - Fedora QA improvement</h2>
<p>Last two months I've been working on some internal projects and looking
a little bit into improving processes, test coverage and QA infrastructure - 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1064895">RHBZ #1064895</a>.
And Rawhide (upcoming Fedora 21) isn't behaving -
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1063245">RHBZ #1063245</a>.</p>
<p>My goal for this year is to do more work on improving the overall test coverage
of Fedora and together with the Fedora QA team bring an
<a href="/blog/2013/11/19/open-source-quality-assurance-infrastructure-for-fedora-qa/">open testing infrastructure</a>
to the community. </p>
<p>Let's see how well that plays out!</p>
<h2>What do I do now</h2>
<p>During the last year I have gradually changed my responsibilities to work more on Fedora.
As a volunteer in the Fedora QA I'm regularly testing installation
of Rawhide trees and try to work closely with the community. I still have to
manage RHEL 5 test cycles where I don't expect nothing disruptive at this stage in the
product life-cycle!</p>
<p>I'm open to any ideas and help which can improve test coverage and quality of software
in Fedora. If you're just joining the open source world this is an excellent
opportunity to do some good, get noticed and even maybe get a job. I will definitely
help you get through the process if you're willing to commit your time to this.</p>
<p>I hope this long post has been useful and fun to read. Please use the comments form to tell
me if I'm missing something or you'd like to know more.</p>

            </p>

            <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/10/moving-tmp-from-ebs-to-instance-storage/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Moving /tmp from EBS to Instance Storage">
                <h2 class="post-title">
                    Moving /tmp from EBS to Instance Storage
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I've seen a fair amount of stories about moving away from Amazon's EBS volumes
to ephemeral instance storage. I've decided to give it a try starting with <code>/tmp</code>
directory where <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> operates.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although instance storage may be available for some instance
types it may not be attached by default. Use this command to check:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/
ami
root
swap
</pre></div>


<p>In the above example there is no instance storage present. </p>
<p>You can attach one either when launching the EC2 instance or when creating a customized AMI
(instance storage devices are pre-defined in the AMI). When creating an AMI you can attach more ephemeral devices
but they will not available when instance is launched. The maximum number of available
instance storage devices can be found in the
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#StorageOnInstanceTypes">docs</a>.
That is to say if you have an AMI which defines 2 ephemeral devices and launch a
standard m1.small instance there will be only one ephemeral device present.</p>
<p>Also note that for M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the
block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, Amazon ignores
any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.</p>
<p>As far as I can see the AWS Console doesn't indicate if instance storage is attached
or not. For instance with 1 ephemeral volume:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/
ami
ephemeral0
root
swap

<span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/ephemeral0
sdb
</pre></div>


<p>Ephemeral devices can be mounted in <code>/media/ephemeralX/</code>, but not all volumes.
I've found that usually only <code>ephemeral0</code> is mounted automatically.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/
ami
ephemeral0
ephemeral1
root

<span class="nv">$ </span>ls -l /media/
drwxr-xr-x <span class="m">3</span> root root <span class="m">4096</span> <span class="m">21</span> ное  <span class="m">2009</span> ephemeral0
</pre></div>


<p>For Difio I have an init.d script which executes when the system
boots. To enable <code>/tmp</code> on ephemeral storage I just added the following snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">$&quot;Mounting /tmp on ephemeral storage:&quot;</span>
<span class="k">for</span> ef in <span class="sb">`</span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/ 2&gt;/dev/null <span class="p">|</span> grep ephemeral<span class="sb">`</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nv">disk</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/block-device-mapping/<span class="nv">$ef</span> 2&gt;/dev/null<span class="sb">`</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$&quot;</span>Unmounting /dev/<span class="nv">$disk</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">    umount /dev/</span><span class="nv">$disk</span><span class="s2"></span>

<span class="s2">    echo </span><span class="nv">$&quot;</span><span class="s2">mkfs /dev/</span><span class="nv">$disk</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
    mkfs.ext4 -q /dev/<span class="nv">$disk</span>

    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$&quot;</span>Mounting /dev/<span class="nv">$disk</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">    mount -t ext4 /dev/</span><span class="nv">$disk</span><span class="s2"> /tmp &amp;&amp; chmod 1777 /tmp &amp;&amp; success || failure</span>
<span class="s2">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>NB:</strong> success and failure are from <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</code>.
If you are using LVM or RAID you need to reconstruct your block devices
accordingly!</p>
<p>If everything goes right I should be able to reduce my AWS costs by saving on
provisioned storage and I/O requests. I'll keep you posted on this after a month or two.</p>

                    Articles of The Week: Git Submodules and Stopping SPAM Without CAPTCHA
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Here are two articles which I found very useful and interesting this week:</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/">Git Submodules: Adding, Using, Removing, Updating</a>
is a clear description of working with git submodules which I had to do recently.
There's a huge comments section with more useful info as well. </p>
<p><a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html">Stopping spambots with hashes and honeypots</a>
is a very interesting read about non-CAPTCHA techniques to stop SPAM bots from filling forms
and comments on your site. I didn't even know these exist but I have to admin this is not my
area of expertise either. The author just scratches the surface of the topic and there are other
methods described in the comments as well. Make sure to read this if you are building forms
or sites with comments.</p>

                    Tip: How to Build updates.img for Fedora
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Anaconda the Fedora, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer has the
capability to incorporate
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Updates">updates at runtime</a>.
These updates are generally distributed as an <code>updates.img</code> file. Here is how
to easily build one from a working installation tree.</p>
<p>Instead of using the git sources to build an updates.img I prefer using the SRPM
from the tree which I am installing. <strike>This way the resulting updates image will be
more consistent with the anaconda version already available in the tree. And in theory
everything you need to build it should already be available as well.</strike>
<strong>UPDATE 2014-02-08:</strong> You can also build the <code>updates.img</code> from the git source tree
which is shown at the bottom of this article. </p>
<p>The following steps work for me on a Fedora 20 system. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download the source RPM for anaconda from the tree and extract the sources to a working
directory. Then;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd </span>anaconda-20.25.16-1
git init
git add .
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;initial import&quot;</span>
git tag anaconda-20.25.16-1
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>The above steps will create a local git repository and tag the initial contents before
modification. The tag is required later by the script which creates the updates image;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After making your changes commit them and from the top anaconda directory execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./scripts/makeupdates -t anaconda-20.25.16-1
</pre></div>


</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add RPM contents to the updates.img but you need to download the packages first:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>yumdownloader python-coverage python-setuptools

./scripts/makeupdates -t anaconda-20.25.16-1 -a ~/python-coverage-3.7-1.fc20.x86_64.rpm -a ~/python-setuptools-1.4.2-1.fc20.noarch.rpm 
BUILDDIR /home/atodorov/anaconda-20.25.16-1
Including anaconda
<span class="m">2</span> RPMs added manually:
python-setuptools-1.4.2-1.fc20.noarch.rpm
python-coverage-3.7-1.fc20.x86_64.rpm
<span class="nb">cd</span> /home/atodorov/anaconda-20.25.16-1/updates <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> rpm2cpio /home/atodorov/python-setuptools-1.4.2-1.fc20.noarch.rpm <span class="p">|</span> cpio -dium
<span class="m">3534</span> blocks
<span class="nb">cd</span> /home/atodorov/anaconda-20.25.16-1/updates <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> rpm2cpio /home/atodorov/python-coverage-3.7-1.fc20.x86_64.rpm <span class="p">|</span> cpio -dium
<span class="m">1214</span> blocks
&lt;stdin&gt; to &lt;stdout&gt; <span class="m">4831</span> blocks

updates.img ready
</pre></div>


<p>In the above example I have only modified the top level anaconda file (<code>/usr/sbin/anaconda</code>
inside the installation environment) experimenting with
<a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">python-coverage</a> integration.</p>
<p>You are done! Make the <code>updates.img</code> available to Anaconda and start using it!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2014-02-08:</strong> If you prefer working with the anaconda source tree here's
how to do it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/anaconda.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>anaconda/
git checkout anaconda-20.25.16-1 -b my_feature-branch

... make changes ...

git commit -a -m <span class="s2">&quot;Fixed something&quot;</span>

./scripts/makeupdates -t anaconda-20.25.16-1

                    AWS Tip: Shrinking EBS Root Volume Size
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Amazon's Elastic Block Store volumes are easy to use and expand but notoriously
hard to shrink once their size has grown. Here is my tip for shrinking EBS size
and saving some money from over-provisioned storage. I'm assuming that you want to
shrink the root volume which is on EBS. </p>
<ul>
<li>Write down the block device name for the root volume (/dev/sda1) - <em>from AWS console:
Instances; Select instance; Look at Details tab; See Root device or Block devices</em>;</li>
<li>Write down the availability zone of your instance - <em>from AWS console: Instances;
column Availability Zone</em>;</li>
<li>Stop instance;</li>
<li>Create snapshot of the root volume;</li>
<li>From the snapshot, create a second volume, in the <strong>same availability zone</strong> as
your instance (you will have to attach it later). This will be your pristine source;</li>
<li>Create new empty EBS volume (not based on a snapshot), with smaller size,
in the same availability zone - <em>from AWS console: Volumes; Create Volume;
Snapshot == No Snapshot</em>; <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - size should be large enough to hold
all the files from the source file system (try <code>df -h</code> on the source first);</li>
<li>Attach both volumes to instance while taking note of the block devices names
you assign for them in the AWS console;</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: In my case <code>/dev/sdc1</code> is the source snapshot and <code>/dev/sdd1</code> is the
empty target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start instance;</li>
<li>Optionally check the source file system with <code>e2fsck -f /dev/sdc1</code>;</li>
<li>Create a file system for the empty volume - <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd1</code>;</li>
<li>Mount volumes at <code>/source</code> and <code>/target</code> respectively;</li>
<li>Now sync the files: <code>rsync -aHAXxSP /source/ /target</code>. <strong>Note the missing slash (/)
after <code>/target</code></strong>. If you add it you will end up with files inside <code>/target/source/</code>
which you don't want;</li>
<li>Quickly verify the new directory structure with <code>ls -l /target</code>;</li>
<li>Unmount <code>/target</code>;</li>
<li>Optionally check the new file system for consistency <code>e2fsck -f /dev/sdd1</code>;</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - check how <code>/boot/grub/grub.conf</code> specifies the root volume - 
by UUID, by LABEL, by device name, etc. You will have to duplicate the same for the
new smaller volume or update <code>/target/boot/grub/grub.conf</code> to match the new volume.
Check <code>/target/etc/fstab</code> as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case I had to <code>e2label /dev/sdd1 /</code> because both <code>grub.conf</code> and <code>fstab</code> were
using the device label.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the instance;</li>
<li>Detach all volumes;</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - attach the new smaller volume to the instance using the same block device
name from the first step (e.g. <code>/dev/sda1</code>);</li>
<li>Start the instance and verify it is working correctly;</li>
<li>DELETE auxiliary volumes and snapshots so they don't take space and accumulate costs!</li>
</ul>
