    <article>
        <p><img alt="QA 101 graduation" src="/images/qa101_final.jpg" title="QA 101 graduation" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of this year I've hosted the first QA related course at
<a href="http://hackbulgaria.com/">HackBulgaria</a>. This is a long overdue post about
how the course went, what worked well and what didn't. Brace yourself because
it is going to be a long one.</p>
<p>The idea behind a QA course has been lurking in both RadoRado's (from HackBulgaria)
and my heads for quite a while. We've been discussing it at least a year before we
actually started. One day Rado told me he'd found a sponsor and we have the go ahead
for the course and that's how it all started!</p>
<p>The first issue was that we weren't prepared to start at a moments notice. I literally
had two weeks to prepare
<a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101">the curriculum</a>
and <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/12/how-to-hire-software-testers-pt-1/">initial interview questions</a>.
Next we opened the application form and left it open until the last possible moment.
I've been reviewing candidate answers hours before the course started, which was
another mistake we made!</p>
<p>On the positive side is that I hosted a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgu0VTxytYw&amp;index=37&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">Q&amp;A session on YouTube</a>
answering general questions about the profession and the course itself. This
live stream helped popularize the course.</p>
<p>At the start we had 30 people and around 13 of them managed to "graduate"
till the final lesson. The biggest portion of students dropped out after the
first 5 lessons of Java crash course! Each lesson was around 4 hours with 20-30
minutes break in the middle.</p>
<p>With respect to the criteria find a first job or find a new/better job I consider the
training successful. To my knowledge all students have found better jobs, many of them
as software testers!</p>
<p>On the practical side of things students managed to find and report 11 interesting
bugs against Fedora. Mind you that these were all found in the wild:
<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5323">fedora-infrastructure #5323</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339701">RHBZ#1339701</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339709">RHBZ#1339709</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339713">RHBZ#1339713</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339719">RHBZ#1339719</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339731">RHBZ#1339731</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339739">RHBZ#1339739</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339742">RHBZ#1339742</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339746">RHBZ#1339746</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340541">RHBZ#1340541</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340891">RHBZ#1340891</a>.</p>
<p>Then students also made a few pull requests on GitHub (3 which I know off):
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-math/pull/38">commons-math #38</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-csv/pull/12">commons-csv #12</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-email/pull/1">commons-email #1</a>.</p>
<h2>Lesson format</h2>
<p>For reference most lessons were a mix of short presentation about theory and best practices
followed by discussions and where appropriate practical sessions with technology or
projects. The exercises were designed for individual work, work in pairs or small groups (4-5)
on purpose.</p>
<p>By request from the sponsors I've tried to keep a detailed record of each student's
performance and personality traits as much as I was able to observe them. I really enjoyed
keeping such a journal but didn't share this info with my students which I consider
a negative issue. I think knowing where your strong and weak areas are would help you
become a better expert in your field!</p>
<h2>Feedback from students</h2>
<ul>
<li>There was little time (to work on the practical examples I guess);</li>
<li>Not having particular practical tasks was a problem. For example we didn't have tasks of the
sort do "X" then "Y";</li>
<li>They needed more time and more attention to be given to them;</li>
<li>Installing different pieces of software and tools took a lot of time and frustration.
It was also quite problematic sometimes depending on whether they used Linux, Windows or Mac OS X;</li>
<li>Working with Eclipse IDE was horrible. Nobody new what to do and the interface
wasn't newbie friendly. Also it took quite a lot of time to install dependencies and/or
import projects to run in Eclipse;</li>
<li>There were a few problems with Selenium and its different versions being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to point out that while these are valid concerns and major issues students were
at least partially guilty for the last 3 of them. It was my impression that most of them
didn't prepare at home, didn't read the next lesson and didn't install prerequisite
tools and software!</p>
<h2>5x Java Crash Course</h2>
<p>We've started with a Java crash course as requested by our sponsors which was extended to
5 instead of the original 3 sessions. RadoRado was teaching Java fundamentals while
I was assisting him with comments.</p>
<p>On the good side is that Rado explains very well and in much details. He also writes code
to demonstrate what he teaches and while doing so uses only the knowledge he's presented
so far. For example if there's a repeating logic/functionality he would just write it
twice instead of refactoring that into a separate function with parameters (assuming
the students have not learned about functions yet). I think this made it more easier
to understand the concepts being taught.</p>
<p>Another positive thing we did was me going behind Rado's computer and modifying some
of the code while he was explaining something on screen. If you take the above example
and have two methods with print out salutations, e.g. "Good morning, Alex" I would go
and modify one of them to include "Mr." while the other will not. This introduced a
change in behavior which ultimately results in a bug! This was a nice practical way
to demonstrate how some classes of bugs get introduced in reality. We did only a few of
these behind the computer changes and I definitely liked them! They were all ad-hoc,
not planned for.</p>
<p>On the negative side Java seems hard to learn and after these 5 lessons half of the
students dropped out. Maybe part of the reason is they didn't expect to start a QA
course with lessons about programming. But that also means they didn't pay enough
attention to the curriculum, which was announced in advance!</p>
<h2>Lesson 01 - QA Fundamentals</h2>
<p>I had made a point to assign time constraints to each exercise in the lessons.
While that mostly worked in the first few lessons, where there is more theory,
we didn't keep the schedule and were overtime.</p>
<p>Explaining testing theory (based on ISTQB fundamentals) took longer than I expected.
it was also evident that we needed more written examples of what different test
analysis techniques are (e.g. boundary value analysis). Here Petar Sabev helped
me deliver few very nice examples.</p>
<p>One of the exercises was "when to stop testing" with an example of a Sudoku solving
function and different environments in which this code operates, e.g. browser, mobile,
etc. Students appeared to have a hard time understanding what a
"runtime environment" is and define relevant tests based on that! I believe most
of the students, due to lack of knowledge and experience, were also having a hard time grasping the
concept of non-functional testing.</p>
<p>A positive thing was that students started explaining to one another and giving
examples for bugs they've seen outside the course.</p>
<h2>Lesson 02 - Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<p>This lesson was designed as role playing game to demonstrate the most common
software development methodologies - waterfall and agile and discuss the QA role
in both of them. The format by itself is very hard to conduct successfully and
this was my first time ever doing this. I've also never taken part of such games
until then, only heard about them.</p>
<p>During the waterfall exercise it was harder for the students to follow the game
constraints and not exchange information with one another because they were sitting
on the same table.</p>
<p>On the positive side all groups came with unique ideas about software features and how
they want to develop them. Timewise we managed to do very well. On the negative side
is that I was the client for all groups and didn't manage to pay enough attention
to everyone, which btw is what clients usually do in real life.</p>
<h2>Lesson 03 - Bug Tracking</h2>
<p>This lesson was a practical exercise in writing bug reports and figuring out what
information needs to be present in a good bug report. Btw this is something I
always ask junior members at job interviews.</p>
<p>First we started with working in pairs to define what a good bug report is
without actually knowing what that means. Students found it hard to brainstorm
together and most of them worked alone during this exercise.</p>
<p>Next students had to write bug reports for some example bugs, which I've explained briefly
on purpose and perform peer reviews of their bugs. Reviews took a long time to complete
but overall students had a good idea of what information to include in a bug report.</p>
<p>Then, after learning from their mistakes and hearing what others had done, they've
learned about some good practices and were tasked to rewrite their bug reports using
the new knowledge. I really like the approach of letting students make some mistakes
and then showing them the easier/better way of doing things. This is also on-par with
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/">Ivan Nemytchenko's methodology</a> of
letting his interns learn by their mistakes.</p>
<p>All bug reports can be found in students repositories, which are forked from the
curriculum. Check out <a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network">https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network</a>.</p>
<p>I should have really asked everyone to file bugs under the curriculum repository so
it is easier for me to track them. On the other hand I wanted each student to start building
their own public profile to show potential employers.</p>
<h2>Lesson 04 - Test Case Management</h2>
<p>This lesson started with an exercise asking students to create accounts for
Red Hat's OpenShift cloud platform in the form of a test scenario. The scenario intentionally
left out some details. The idea being that missing information introduces inconsistencies
during testing and to demonstrate how the same steps were performed slightly differently.</p>
<p>We had some troubles explaining exactly "how did you test" because most inexperienced people
would not remember all details about where they clicked, did they use the mouse or the
keyboard, was the tab order correct, etc. Regardless students managed to receive different
results and discover that some email providers were not supported.</p>
<p>The homework assignment was to create test plans and test cases in Nitrate at
<a href="https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/">https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/</a>. Unfortunately the system appears to be down ATM
and I don't have time to investigate why. This piece of infrastructure was put together
in 2 hours and I'm surprised it lasted without issues during the entire course.</p>
<h2>2x Introduction to Linux</h2>
<p>This was a crash course in Linux fundamentals and exercise with most common commands
and text editors in the console. Most of the students were not prepared with virtual
machines. We've also used a cloud provider to give students remote shell but the
provider API was failing and we had to deploy docker containers manually. Overall
infrastructure was a big problem but we somehow managed. Another problem was with
ssh clients from Windows who generated keys in a format that our cloud provider
couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Wrt commands and exercises students did well and managed to execute most of them
on their own. That's very good for people who've never seen a terminal in their lives
(more or less).</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Testing Fedora 24(25) Changes</h2>
<p>Once again nobody was prepared with a virtual machine with Fedora and students
were installing software as we go. Because of that we didn't manage to conduct
the lesson properly and had to repeat it on the next session.</p>
<p>Rawhide being the bleeding edge of Fedora means it is full of bugs. Well I couldn't
keep up with everyone and explain workarounds or how to install/upgrade Fedora.
That was a major setback. It also became evident that you can't move quickly
if you have no idea what to do and no instructions about it either.</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Again</h2>
<p>Once prepared with the latest and greatest from Rawhide the task was to analyze the
proposed feature changes (on the Fedora wiki) and create test plans and design
test cases for said changes. Then execute the tests in search for bugs. This is where
some of the bugs above came from. The rest were found during upgrades.</p>
<p>This lesson was team work (4-5 students) but the results were mixed. IMO Fedora changes
are quite hard to grasp, especially if you lack domain knowledge and broader knowledge
about the structure and operation of a Linux distribution. I don't think most teams
were able to clearly understand their chosen features and successfully create good
plans/scenarios for them. On the other hand in real life software you don't necessarily
understand the domain better and know what to do. I've been in situations where
whole features have been defined by a single sentence and requested to be tested by QA.</p>
<p>One of the teams didn't manage to install Fedora (IIRC they didn't have laptops
capable of running a VM) and were not able to conduct the exercise.</p>
<p>Being able to find real life bugs, some of them serious, and getting traction in Bugzilla
is the most positive effect of this lesson. I personally wanted to have more output
(e.g. more bugs, more cases defined, etc) but taking into account the blocking factors
and setbacks I think this is a good initial result.</p>
<h2>Lesson 06 - Unit Testing and Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Here we had a few examples of bad stubs and mocks which were not received very well.
The topic is hard in itself and wasn't very well explained with practical examples.</p>
<p>Another negative thing is that students took a lot of time to fiddle around with
Eclipse, they were mistyping commands in the terminal and generally not paying enough
attention to instructions. This caused the exercises to go slowly.</p>
<p>We've had an exercise which asks the student to write a new test for a non-existing
method. Then implement the method and make sure all the tests passed. You guessed it
this is Test Driven Development.
IIRC one of the students was having a hard time with that exercise so I popped up
my editor on the large screen and started typing what she told me, then re-running the
tests and asking her to show me the errors I've made and tell me how to correct them.
The exercise was received very well and was fun to do.</p>
<p>Due to lack of time we had to go over TravisCI very quickly. The other bad thing about
TravisCI is that it requires git/GitHub and the students were generally inexperienced
with that. Both GitHub for Windows and Mac OS suck a big time IMO. What you need is the
console. However none of the students had any practical experience with git and knew
how to commit code and push branches to GitHub. git fundamentals however is a separate
one or two lessons by itself which we didn't do.</p>
<h2>Lesson 07 - Writing JUnit tests for Apache Commons</h2>
<p>Excluding the problems with Eclipse and the GitHub desktop client and
missing instructions for Windows the hardest part of this lesson was actually
selecting a component to work on, understanding what the code does and actually
writing meaningful tests. On top of that most students were not very proficient
programmers and Java was completely new to them.</p>
<p>Despite having 3 pull requests on GitHub I consider this lesson to be a failure.</p>
<h2>Lesson 08 - Integration Testing with Selenium</h2>
<p>This lesson starts with an example of what a flaky test it. At the moment I don't
think this lesson is the best place for that example. To make things even more difficult
the example is in Python (because that way was the easiest for me to write it) instead
of Java. Students had problems installing Python on Windows just to make this example work.
They also were lacking the knowledge how to execute a script in the terminal.</p>
<p>One of the students proposed a better flaky example utilizing dates and times and
executing it during various hours of the day. I have yet to code this and
prepare environment in which it would be executed. Btw recently I've seen similar behavior
caused by inconsistent timezone usage in Ruby which resulted in unexpected time offset
a little after midnight :).</p>
<p>Once again I have to point out that students came generally unprepared for the lesson
and haven't installed prerequisite software and programming languages. This is becoming
a trend and needs to be split out into a preparation session, possibly with a check
list.</p>
<p>On the Selenium side, starting with Selenium IDE, it was a bit unclear how to use it
and what needs to be done. This is another negative trend, where students were missing clear
instructions what they are expected to do. At the end we did resort to live demo
using Selenium IDE so they can at least get some idea about it.</p>
<h2>Lesson 09 and 10 - Writing Selenium tests for Mozilla Add-ons website</h2>
<p>IMO these two lessons are the biggest disaster of the entire course. Python &amp; virtualenv
on Windows was a total no go but on Linux things weren't much easier because students
had no idea what a virtualenv is.</p>
<p>Practice wise they haven't managed to read all the bugs on the Mozilla bug tracker and
had a very hard time selecting bugs to write tests for. Not to mention that many of the
reported bugs were administrative tasks to create or remove add-on categories. There
weren't many functional related bugs to write tests for.</p>
<p>The product under test was also hard to understand and most students were seeing it for the first
time, let alone getting to know the devel and testing environments that Mozilla provides.
Mozilla's test suite being in Python is just another issue to make contribution harder
because we've never actually studied Python.</p>
<p>Between the two lessons there were students who've missed the Selenium introduction
lesson and were having even harder time to figure things out. I didn't have the time
to explain and go back to the previous lesson for them.
Maybe an attendance policy is needed for dependent lessons.</p>
<p>Before the course started I've talked to some guys at Mozilla's IRC channel and
they agreed to help but at the end we didn't even engage with them. At this point
I'm skeptical that mentoring over IRC would have worked anyway.</p>
<h2>Lesson 11 - Introduction to Performance Testing</h2>
<p>This was a more theoretical lesson with less practical examples and exercises.
I have provided some blog posts of mine related to the topic of performance
testing but in general they are related to software that I've used which isn't
generally known to a less experienced audience (Celery, Twisted). These blog posts
IMO were hard to put into perspective and didn't serve a good purpose as examples.</p>
<p>The practical part of the lesson was a discussion with the goal of creating a
performance testing strategy for GitHub's infrastructure. It was me who was
doing most of the talking because students have no experience working on such
a large infrastructure like GitHub and didn't know what components might be
there, how they might be organized (load balancers, fail overs, etc)
and what needs to be tested.</p>
<p>There was also a more practical example to create a performance test in Java for
one of the classes found in <code>commons-codec/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/digest</code>.
Again the main difficulty here was working fluently with Eclipse, getting the projects to
build/run and knowing how the software under test was supposed to work and be executed.</p>
<h2>Lesson 12 - How to find 1000 bugs in 30 minutes</h2>
<p>This was a more relaxed lesson with examples of simple types of bugs found on a
large scale. Most examples came from my blog and experiments I've made against
Fedora.</p>
<p>While amusing and fun I don't think all of the students understood me and kept
their attention. Part of that is because Fedora tends to focus on low level
stuff and my examples were not necessarily easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Feedback from the sponsor</h2>
<p>Experian Bulgaria was the exclusive sponsor for this course. At the end of the summer
Rado and I met with them to discuss the results of the training. Here's what they say</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall technical knowledge they consider to be weak. What they need are people
with basic knowledge in the field of object oriented programming, databases, operating
systems and networking. These are skills candidates need in order to work for Experian.
It must be noted that most of them were not taught at this course!</li>
<li>English language proficiency for all students is low on average;</li>
<li>User level experience with Linux was fine but students were missing deeper
knowledge about the operating system. Once again something we didn't teach;</li>
<li>The programming languages favored at Experian are Java and Ruby and students
had poor knowledge of them. They also had weak understanding of OOP principles;</li>
<li>According to Experian students were more ingrained with the development mindset
and were trying their luck in the QA profession instead of genuinely being interested
in the field. While this is generally the case I have to point out that as sponsor
Experian did a poor job at promoting their company and the QA profession
as a whole. What isn't known to the general public is their big in-house
QA community which could have served as a source of inspiration for the students!</li>
<li>Low motivation and lack of fundamental knowledge from university are other
traits interviewers at Experian have identified. They argued for a stronger
acceptance process and a requirement of minimum 2 years of university
education in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the topic of testing knowledge candidates did mostly OK, however
we don't have enough information about this. Also the hiring process at
Experian is more focused on the broader knowledge areas listed above so
substantial improvement in the testing knowledge of candidates doesn't given
them much head start.</p>
<p>While to my knowledge they didn't hire anyone few people
received an offer but declined due to various personal reasons. I view this
as poor performance on our side but Experian thinks otherwise and are willing
to sponsor another round of training.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here is a list of all the things that could be improved</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time to develop the curriculum and have it pass QA review by other
experienced testers (in particular such that also teach students);</li>
<li>Make the application process harder to include people with broader IT knowledge;</li>
<li>Allow time to review all applicants;</li>
<li>Find a co-trainer and additional mentors for some of the exercises;</li>
<li>Minimize the number of students accepted in the course so we can handle everyone
with more care;</li>
<li>Give homework assignments and examine them before each lesson;</li>
<li>Collect and provide performance review at the end of the course;</li>
<li>Minimize the technology stack and tools used;</li>
<li>Host a technology preparation session at the beginning paired
with a check list of all the things that need to be done. Very likely
make the chosen technology stack a hard requirement to avoid setbacks
later in the schedule;</li>
<li>We need more fundamental lessons like practical git tutorial,
practical Linux tutorial, databases, networking, etc.</li>
<li>Same goes for Java or any other programming language. Each of these technologies
easily makes a course by itself. Possibly include technology skill assessment
in the application form and reject candidates who don't meet the minimum level.
This is to ensure the group is able to move at the same pace.</li>
<li>We need to improve the infrastructure used during the course,
especially exercise bug tracking and test case management systems;</li>
<li>Students need clear instructions for every exercise - what is required from them,
what the expected result is and what they need to be doing, etc;</li>
<li>Provide more examples for just about everything. Also make the examples
easier to understand/simple with the harder examples left for further
reading;</li>
<li>Provide easier projects to work on. This means applications whose domain
is easier to understand and closer to what experiences the students might have.
Also projects need clear instructions how to join and how to contribute with tests.</li>
<li>The same application/software needs to be used for manual bug finding,
unit test writing and integration test with Selenium. This will minimize
both context and technology switches and allow to view various testing
activities in the context of a single software under test;</li>
<li>While using open source projects for the above listed purposes sounds great
the reality is that they are hard to join and will not move according to our
schedule. Maybe less focus on open source per-se and more focus on a particular
application under test. Instructors can then proxy all the tests forward
to the upstream community;</li>
<li>Focus more on practice and less on exotic topics like performance testing
and large scale bug finding;</li>
<li>Seek more active participation from sponsors!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions please comment below, especially if you can tell me
how to implement them in practice.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>
