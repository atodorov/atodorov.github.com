  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m taking part in a discussion at Sofia University targeted towards
young students. Speakers are well-known IT professionals and I&#8217;m honored to be invited.</p>

<p>One of the preliminary questions posted from students is</p>

<blockquote><p>In which field to expect saturation of junior specialists in the next 5 years?<br/>Which technologies will see higher demand and which will not?</p></blockquote>


<p>While I don&#8217;t have a clear answer here are my favorites and comments. If I was a 20 year old
student I would definitely be paying attention to these.</p>

<h2>Quality Engineering, Quality Assurance, Test Automation</h2>

<p>The more software gets written, the more critical the need to test it.
In the past 6+ years I&#8217;ve been working in the field of QA and saw 5x rise in
the workload and number of team members I&#8217;ve been working with. Traditionally
Bulgaria is strong on the development side but lacks trained QA engineers.
In the past I have also been approached by several foreign companies to train
their QA staff and organize their QA processes. The situation here is not very
different even today.</p>

<p>If you want a secure job become a top-notch QA with experience ranging from
test automation, QA management, bug finding and all between. Strongly recommended
is to get some industry recognized certificates (I don&#8217;t have such for QA).</p>

<h2>DevOps</h2>

<p>Looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> is the new mantra.
With advancement of cloud technologies and everything becoming as-a-service
my gut is telling me that more and more organization will be switching to DevOps
types of operations in an attempt to be faster, more cost effective and more agile.
I myself am looking into this field.</p>

<p>While I haven&#8217;t done a formal research to back-up my words I think DevOps will be
a hot topic in the next 5 years until it becomes the norm. Acquire DevOps skills
if you are particularly interested in working for start-ups or small engineering
organizations serving large customer bases (e.g Disqus, GitHub, The Guardian).</p>

<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">AR</a> is not a fiction anymore.
We have everything we need to make use of it in everyday life and it&#8217;s slowly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass">becoming mainstream</a>.
If you are into maths, algorithms and research then this is your field. Couple
with mobile devices, social networks, big data and cloud and you have a job
for a life time.</p>

<h2>What else?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a crystal ball to predict the future. It could be that my IT jobs
predictions are totally wrong. Let me know what do you think. If you were in the
beginning of your career which fields will you bet on?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/bkvf_sofia.png" alt="BkVF Sofia" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/></p>

<p><a href="http://www.balkanventureforum.org/">Balkan Venture Forum</a> in Sofia is over. It&#8217;s been two
very exciting days, full of many interesting talks both on stage and off stage.</p>

<p>There were so many things that happened and so many new people I met that it will be hard
to mention all of that in a single blog post. I just want to highlight the things I enjoyed
the most.</p>

<br /><br />


<h2>Networking &amp; pitching at the bar</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been invited to BkVF long ago. However my initial intention was not to attend because
this month proved to be very busy. I&#8217;ve changed my mind after Boyan Benev, one of the organizers
invited me 10 days ago with an interesting proposal - distribute <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>&#8217;s beer mats at the bar!</p>

<p><img src="/images/difio_beermats.jpg" alt="Difio beer mats" style="float:left;clear:both;display:inline-block;"/></p>

<p>So I was there for the networking. As I used to say when people asked me if I was pitching</p>

<blockquote><p>I am pitching at the bar!</p></blockquote>


<p>Networking was very intensive both during the coffee breaks and cocktail and during the sessions.
I&#8217;ve now got close to 50 new business cards in my pocket. I&#8217;ve met very cool guys and gals both
developers and non-tech.</p>

<p>From the companies that were pitching in the main hall I particularly liked
<a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a>, <a href="http://transmetrics.eu/">Transmetrics</a> and <a href="http://kimola.com/">Kimola</a>.
Imagga was probably the most deep-tech/science oriented company at BkVF while Transmetrics
and Kimola focus on cloud and big data solutions.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry development session</h2>

<p>OK, I&#8217;m not into mobile technology nor smart phones but that may change soon.
BlackBerry had a strong presence and I was able to talk to some of their developer
support folks.
The OS of BlackBerry 10 is based on QNX kernel with multiple SDKs available to write apps.
Most of all I like the fact that it is POSIX compliant with C/C++ native SDK available.
Qt/QML is also available.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in how hard it will be to port
some existing open source tools to BlackBerry. I&#8217;m talking Bash, Python and the
command line tools I currently use on Linux. I&#8217;ll be contacting them in the near future
to get a device for testing and hacking and will keep you posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How to compare two images in Python? A tricky question with quite a few answers.
Since my needs are simple, my solution is simpler!</p>

<p><img src="/images/difio_compare.png" alt="Difio Google +1 changes" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
<a href="http://www.dif.io">dif.io</a> homepage before and after it got a G+1.</p>

<h2>ImageMagic is magic</h2>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagic</a> then you&#8217;ve been
living in a cave on a deserted island! The suite contains the <code>compare</code> command
which mathematically and visually annotates the difference between two images.</p>

<p>The third image above was produced with:</p>

<pre><code>$ compare difio_10.png difio_11.png difio_diff.png
</code></pre>

<p>Differences are displayed in red (default) and the original image is seen in the
background. As shown, the Google +1 button and count has changed between the two
images. <code>compare</code> is a nice tool for manual inspection and debugging.
It works well in this case because the images are lossless PNGs and are regions of
screen shots where most objects are the same.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chestnut_compare.jpg" alt="JPEG quality reduction" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
Chestnuts I had in Rome. 100% to 99% quality reduction.</p>

<p>As seen on the second image set only 1% of JPEG quality change leads to many small
differences in the image, which are invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Python Imaging Library aka PIL</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> is another powerful tool for
image manipulation. I googled around and found some answers to my original
questions
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1927660/compare-two-images-the-python-linux-way">here</a>.
The proposed solution is to calculate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square">RMS</a> of the two images
and compare that with some threshold to establish the level of certainty that
two images are identical.</p>

<h2>Simple solution</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a script lately which needs to know what is displayed on
the screen and recognize some of the objects. Calculating image similarity is
quite complex but comparing if two images are <strong>exactly</strong> identical is not.
Given my environment and the fact
that I&#8217;m comparing screen shots where only few areas changed
(see first image above for example) led to the following solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a screen shot;</li>
<li>Crop a particular area of the image which needs to be examined;</li>
<li>Compare to a baseline image of the same area created manually;</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use RMS, use the image histogram only to speed up calculation.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve prepared the baseline images with GIMP and tested couple of scenarios
using <code>compare</code>. Here&#8217;s how it looks in code:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">PIL</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Image</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">screenshot</span><span class="p">())</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">img</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">crop</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">860</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">950</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">region</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">histogram</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">baseline_histogram</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The presented solution was easy to program, works fast and reliably for my use case.
In fact after several iterations I&#8217;ve added a second baseline image to account for some
unidentified noise which appears randomly in the first region. As far as I can tell
the two checks combined are 100% accurate.</p>

<h2>Field of application</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m working on QA automation where this comes handy. However you may try some
lame CAPTCHA recognition by comparing regions to a pre-defined baseline. Let me know
if you come up with a cool idea or actually used this in code.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear
about interesting projects which didn&#8217;t get too complicated because of image
recognition.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This article is a step-by-step guide to using two passwords with <a href="http://www.arg0.net/encfs">EncFS</a>.
The primary password is required and may be used to secure all data;
the secondary password is optional and may be stored on USB stick or
other removable media and used to secure more sensitive data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/encfs_raleigh.jpg" alt="Article in Raleigh" style="clear:both;display:block;"/>
The original article in Red Hat&#8217;s Raleigh HQ!</p>

<p>This article has been originally written for and published by
<a href="http://magazine.redhat.com/2007/06/13/dual-password-encryption-with-encfs/">Red Hat Magazine</a>.
Here is a shortened version with updated commands for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.</p>

<h2>Technical Information</h2>

<p>EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. EncFS provides security
against offline attacks like a stolen notebook.
EncFS works on files and directories, not an entire block device.
It modifies file names and contents.
The data is stored on the underlying filesystem and meta-data is preserved.
File attributes such as ownership, modification date and permission bits are not encrypted
and are visible to anybody. EncFS is acting like a translator between the user and
the filesystem, encrypting and decrypting on the fly.</p>

<p>EncFS is easy to use and requires no special setup. A local user has to be in the ‘fuse’
group to use EncFS. It does not require ‘root’ privileges.
EncFS can be used with secondary passwords. This could be used to store a separate set of files on the same encrypted filesystem.
EncFS ignores files which do not decode properly, so files created with separate passwords will
only be visible when the filesystem is mounted with the associated password.
There is the option to read passwords from an external program or stdin (standard input).
This option combined with custom scripting makes EncFS very flexible.
By default, all FUSE based filesystems are visible only to the user who mounted them.
No other users (including root) can view the filesystem contents.</p>

<h2>Installing EncFS</h2>

<p>Install fuse-encfs from <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a>:</p>

<pre><code># yum install fuse-encfs
</code></pre>

<p>Load the FUSE module:</p>

<pre><code># /sbin/modprobe fuse
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, add any users that will use EncFS to group ‘fuse’:</p>

<pre><code># usermod -Gfuse jdoe
</code></pre>

<h2>Using EncFS</h2>

<p>Using EncFS does not differ from using any other filesystem.
The only thing you need to do is to mount it somewhere and start creating
files and directories under the mount point.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Use only absolute path names with EncFS!</p>

<p>Create working directories:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/encrypted ~/plain
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>plain/</code> – looks like a normal directory. All files stored here look like normal
files for the user who mounted this directory with EncFS. This acts like a virtual
directory performing encryption and decryption.</li>
<li><code>encrypted/</code> – looks garbled. The actual data is stored here and is encrypted.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you can mount the new EncFS volume for the first time. This assumes a default configuration:</p>

<pre><code>$ encfs /home/jdoe/encrypted /home/jdoe/plain
Creating new encrypted volume.
Please choose from one of the following options:
 enter "x" for expert configuration mode,
 enter "p" for pre-configured paranoia mode,
 anything else, or an empty line will select standard mode.
?&gt; 

Standard configuration selected.

Configuration finished.  The filesystem to be created has
the following properties:
Filesystem cipher: "ssl/aes", version 3:0:2
Filename encoding: "nameio/block", version 3:0:1
Key Size: 192 bits
Block Size: 1024 bytes
Each file contains 8 byte header with unique IV data.
Filenames encoded using IV chaining mode.
File holes passed through to ciphertext.

Now you will need to enter a password for your filesystem.
You will need to remember this password, as there is absolutely
no recovery mechanism.  However, the password can be changed
later using encfsctl.

New Encfs Password: **********
Verify Encfs Password: **********
</code></pre>

<p>Create a file:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "some content" &gt; ~/plain/file.one
</code></pre>

<p>Check contents in <code>plain/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/plain/
total 12
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:31 .
drwx------. 6 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:29 ..
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe   13 May 14 21:31 file.one

$ cat ~/plain/file.one 
some content
</code></pre>

<p>Check what’s in <code>encrypted/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/encrypted/
total 16
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:31 .
drwx------. 6 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:29 ..
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe 1083 May 14 21:30 .encfs6.xml
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe   21 May 14 21:31 Wq5NZ6q-yP-fYNWYsjzFhHf9
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>.encfs6.xml</code> is a special file. When performing backups or restoring data,
make sure to keep this file!</p>

<p>Inspect the contents of encrypted file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat ~/encrypted/Wq5NZ6q-yP-fYNWYsjzFhHf9 
���r�N�M���"p��
</code></pre>

<p>Unmount the filesystem and mount it again with another password:</p>

<pre><code>$ fusermount -u ~/plain/
$ encfs --anykey /home/jdoe/encrypted /home/jdoe/plain
EncFS Password: *****
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Caution:</strong> We are using the &#8211;anykey option to allow secondary passwords.</p>

<p>Check <code>plain/</code> again. The directory is empty. Previous files were not decoded with the new password.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/plain/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:31 .
drwx------. 6 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:29 ..
</code></pre>

<p>Now create another file that will be in “hidden” mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "hidden contents" &gt; ~/plain/file.two
</code></pre>

<p>Check again what’s in <code>encrypted/</code>. Both files are stored in the same directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/encrypted/
total 20
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:35 .
drwx------. 6 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:29 ..
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe 1083 May 14 21:30 .encfs6.xml
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe   24 May 14 21:35 PfkZHs16YsKkznnTujaVsOuS
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe   21 May 14 21:31 Wq5NZ6q-yP-fYNWYsjzFhHf9
</code></pre>

<p>Unmount and mount again using the first password:</p>

<pre><code>$ fusermount -u ~/plain/
$ encfs --anykey /home/jdoe/encrypted /home/jdoe/plain
EncFS Password: **********
</code></pre>

<p>Inspect the contents of <code>plain/</code> again. The second file was not decoded properly and is not shown:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la ~/plain/
total 12
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:35 .
drwx------. 6 jdoe jdoe 4096 May 14 21:29 ..
-rw-rw-r--. 1 jdoe jdoe   13 May 14 21:31 file.one
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>You have learned how to use encryption to protect your data.
There is also a nice graphical application
for using EncFS with KDE called <a href="http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=54078">K-EncFS</a>.
I&#8217;ll be happy to answer any questions or comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Can a company like Instagram be founded in Europe and successfully exit for
$ 1 billion?</em> What do you think ?</p>

<p>This is precisely the question <a href="http://speedupgroup.com/about-us/">Bartłomiej Gola</a>
asked at WebIT BG last week. Here are his answers.</p>

<h2>Theory says yes</h2>

<p>In theory Europe is well suited for successful companies:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have talented software engineers and hackers;</li>
<li>Great ideas are available everywhere;</li>
<li>Funding is available - both early stage seed funding as well
as VCs.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Forget about it</h2>

<p>The short answer though is &#8220;forget about it&#8221;! There are several
major differences between Europe and Silicon Valley which
could break your start-up easily.</p>

<p>1) Europe doesn&#8217;t have a strong branding with respect to technology.
We are not perceived as a strong tech community which produces great things.
Not to mention individual countries like Bulgaria.
This means foreign investors are
less likely to invest in European companies because they haven&#8217;t heard
about other successful companies coming from the region.</p>

<p>We as a community should work together and popularize the region
(especially South Eastern Europe). I&#8217;ve seen this already in action.
German cloud provider <a href="http://cloudcontrol.de">cloudControl</a> has
branded their website as &#8220;Proudly Made In Berlin&#8221;.</p>

<p>2) The lack of reputation leads to the second issue - less followers
on social media. Think about it! How many people in the US or Silicon Valley
do you follow on Twitter? How many follow you back? How many of those who
do, actually engage with what you share?</p>

<p>With some exceptions like my friend <a href="http://batsov.com">Bozhidar Batsov</a> your
social reach is quite limited when it comes to hi-tech users.</p>

<p>3) Less reputation plus less social reach means less buzz and less early
adopters. Silicon Valley is a great place to generate buzz and find
early adopters. Because of the software industry and many start-ups
located in the area people generally have more open mindset and
will try out new ideas, share valuable feedback, engage in social media
and spread the word.</p>

<p>Early adopters are crucial for every start-up. And we don&#8217;t have this
mindset in Europe. I have seen it myself. From 400 friends and co-workers
whom I&#8217;ve contacted via LinkedIn, half or more of them in Europe,
only a few, not even a dozen have tried <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>.
And we are talking about service from developers about developers. Nada.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried another experiment as well. This time about non IT business.
From around 100 female friends on Facebook around 10 followed a
<a href="http://facebook.com/obuvki41plus">Facebook page</a>
which I&#8217;ve invited them to. The page is
<a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">online ladies shoes shop</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do about it?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a clear answer here. We need to work hard and
make Europe and Bulgaria well known in the software industry
and start-up community. I encourage everyone to try, fail, try, fail
and try until they succeed. And brag about what you do all the time.</p>

<p>This also prompted me another question. &#8220;How do companies in the Bulgarian
start-up eco-system find their early adopters?&#8221; I think I&#8217;m gonna start
a new blog category  dedicated to this topic.</p>

<p>Is your company the next Instagram? Please use the comments and tell me.</p>

<h2>What is Elsys?</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/">Elsys</a></strong> (in Bulgarian TUES) is a technology school in Sofia.
It is a subsidiary of Technical University of Sofia and this week they&#8217;ve celebrated their 25th anniversary.
Elsys is not an ordinary school, they teach computer science to these young kids.
And they do it pretty damn well. At the moment it&#8217;s the best
school to study IT (software, hardware, networks) in the country, contrary to what TU Sofia has
become :(.</p>

<p>As one of the school <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GYbCDGTz-4">sponsors</a> I met lots of the students
and want to show everyone else what they are doing. I have no doubts we will be hearing more about
them in the future.</p>

<h2>Robots first</h2>

<p>So these boys and girls make robots. I was there when the first image was taken.
It was this week in Thursday, April 25th at an educational fair. All visitors were
fascinated by the robots and stopped by to watch and play with them. I personally
wanted to see and play with the quadcopter shown above but it was not available that
day.</p>

<p>While I was there, a guy approached the kids and said his
company wants to fund development of another quadcopter. He wanted a bigger one, which
is able to carry equipment for aerial photographs.</p>

<p>What shook me was that
this is a rare occasion where a local business wants to fund R&amp;D activities.
Not to mentions these are school boys, not university students or research fellows
where this is more
common. And this happened days after the news about the quadcopter has been released
in the social media.</p>

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="450" height="403"><param name="movie" value="http://i47.vbox7.com/player/ext.swf?vid=cecb1d1ca4"/><param name="quality" value="high"/><embed src="http://i48.vbox7.com/player/ext.swf?vid=cecb1d1ca4" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="450" height="403"/></object>


<p>Elsys also teaches Arduino classes where students play with home made robots. I personally
have attended a robots competition held in the school where these small robots compete
and sometimes fight with one another.</p>

<p>Did I mention they take part in First Lego League too? Just see the
<a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/blog/article/fll-2012-new-teams-better-robots-lots-of-emotions/">photos</a>.</p>

<h2>Open source</h2>

<p>When not making robots students from Elsys hack open source and as it happened,
one of them won the grand prize in Google Code-In 2012
(<a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/blog/article/elsys-student-won-the-grand-prize-in-the-google-code-in-2012/">article in Bulgarian</a>).
For the last few years kids from Elsys are taking part in Google Code-In and according
to the <a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/blog/article/7300-from-google/">school website</a>
they&#8217;ve made $7300 from Google :). <a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/blog/article/google-code-in-2011/">Over 40</a>
boys and girls took part in the first
edition of Google Code-In. That&#8217;s 10% of all participants.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure Google and others were impressed by the fact so many good developers
are coming from a single school. Aren&#8217;t you?</p>

<h2>Cisco Networking Academy</h2>

<p>Yup, they have this too! Elsys teams have won top honors at 6 of the last 8
BANA-sponsored
<a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org/blog/article/national-networking-competition-2012/">National Networking Competitions</a>.
Cisco themselves wrote an <a href="http://csr.cisco.com/pages/impact-bulgaria">article about Elsys</a>.</p>

<h2>Want to help</h2>

<p>As I said I&#8217;m a school sponsor. Probably the smallest one. If you want to help
these kids and their school just let me know. I will put you in touch with the
principal.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can donate your time and knowledge and start teaching an interesting
class at school!</p>

<p>Or you can donate high quality IT books if you have such. Anything helps.</p>

<p>Have you ever been a victim of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud">credit card fraud</a>? Meet yours truly!
Achievement unlocked! As a hacker I&#8217;m more careful when shopping online compared to ordinary
people and still my card was misused.</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p>Right after opening business hours I was awaken by a phone call from my bank. They alerted
me about a 6$ payment for a hotel reservation, which obviously I didn&#8217;t make.
The payment in question was made yesterday, April 25th.
Ten minutes later I got another call telling me about more transactions, some successful ones.
One in particular - a train ticket for nearly 250 EUR. My card was blocked
immediately! The nice thing is that the bank clerk agreed to
express issue a new card. Not without some help from my internal connections at the central office
I got my fresh card before closing hours this evening. The ink on the paper slip was still wet,
literary.</p>

<p>What will happen next is that they will charge me the successful transactions (not big amount) and later I have to
file a claim for refund. That will take around a week I suppose. I&#8217;ve filed such claims before and
things usually work well for the customer (the case was incorrect merchant though).</p>

<h2>How did this happen?</h2>

<p>Honestly I have no idea and will probably never find out.
But as I said I take precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have additional account with small amount in it just for online shopping
to minimize risk;</li>
<li>I use strong passwords with above average length of symbols (no I&#8217;m not going to tell you how much);</li>
<li>I enter my card number <strong>ONLY</strong> over trusted SSL connections;</li>
<li>I avoid smaller merchants and tend to shop from one or two places only;</li>
<li>If I remember correctly I&#8217;ve never purchased anything online where the card verification
code and additional information like expiration date and billing address is not required.
If I did, I&#8217;ve been drunk then.</li>
<li>I monitor all my accounts activity as well.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition the card in question was mostly used for cloud service subscriptions like
Amazon Web Services and Google Apps. I have used it a few times for other things
like plane tickets or travel reservations but nothing fishy.</p>

<p>The same card I&#8217;ve used rarely at physical ATM or POS terminal (once a year probably).</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s your story?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d like to use this unfortunate event to raise the topic and awareness among
my readers. I wish you never experience this. Forget the money side of things,
it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to deal with this.</p>

<p>If you happen to on the victim side please share your story. Have things
worked in your favor or not?</p>

<p>The picture above shows a new credit card concept. Per the author:</p>

<blockquote><p>Kudelski and Mastercard are showing me the credit card of the future.<br/>This model can generate a new passcode on the fly, so if your card&#8217;s number<br/>gets copied it won&#8217;t be able to generate the right passcode.</p></blockquote>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this article I will show you how to deploy hotfix versions for
Python packages on the RedHat <a href="http://openshift.com">OpenShift</a> PaaS cloud.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>You are already running a Python application on your OpenShift instance.
You are using some 3rd party dependencies when you find a bug in one of them.
You go forward, fix the bug and submit a
<a href="https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic/pull/31">pull request</a>.
You don&#8217;t want to wait for upstream to release a new version but rather
build a hotfix package yourself and deploy to production immediately.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>There are two basic approaches to solving this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Include the hotfix package source code in your application, i.e.
add it to your git tree or;</li>
<li>Build the hotfix separately and deploy as a dependency. Don&#8217;t
include it in your git tree, just add a requirement on the hotfix version.</li>
</ol>


<p>I will talk about the later. The tricky part here is to instruct the cloud environment
to use your package (including the proper location) and not upstream or their local
mirror.</p>

<p>Python applications hosted at <a href="http://openshift.com">OpenShift</a> don&#8217;t support
<code>requirements.txt</code> which can point to various package sources and even install
packages directly from GitHub. They support <code>setup.py</code> which fetches packages
from <a href="http://pypi.python.org">http://pypi.python.org</a> but it is flexible enough to support other locations.</p>

<h2>Building the hotfix</h2>

<p>First of all we&#8217;d like to build a hotfix package. This will be the upstream
version that we are currently using plus the patch for our critical issue:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/python-magic/python-magic-0.4.3.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf python-magic-0.4.3.tar.gz 
$ cd python-magic-0.4.3
$ curl https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic/pull/31.patch | patch 
</code></pre>

<p>Verify the patch has been applied correctly and then modify <code>setup.py</code> to
increase the version string. In this case I will set it to <code>version='0.4.3.1'</code>.</p>

<p>Then build the new package using <code>python setup.py sdist</code> and upload it to a web server.</p>

<h2>Deploying to OpenShift</h2>

<p>Modify <code>setup.py</code> and specify the hotfix version. Because this version is not on PyPI
and will not be on OpenShift&#8217;s local mirror you need to provide the location where it can
be found. This is done with the <code>dependency_links</code> parameter to <code>setup()</code>. Here&#8217;s how it looks:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='diff'><span class='line'><span class="gh">diff --git a/setup.py b/setup.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gh">index c6e837c..2daa2a9 100644</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gd">--- a/setup.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gi">+++ b/setup.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gu">@@ -6,5 +6,6 @@ setup(name=&#39;YourAppName&#39;,</span>
</span><span class='line'>       author=&#39;Your Name&#39;,
</span><span class='line'>       author_email=&#39;example@example.com&#39;,
</span><span class='line'>       url=&#39;http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/&#39;,
</span><span class='line'><span class="gd">-      install_requires=[&#39;python-magic==0.4.3&#39;],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gi">+      dependency_links=[&#39;https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/python-magic-0.4.3.1.tar.gz&#39;],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gi">+      install_requires=[&#39;python-magic==0.4.3.1&#39;],</span>
</span><span class='line'>      )
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now just git push to OpenShift and observe the console output:</p>

<pre><code>remote: Processing dependencies for YourAppName==1.0
remote: Searching for python-magic==0.4.3.1
remote: Best match: python-magic 0.4.3.1
remote: Downloading https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/python-magic-0.4.3.1.tar.gz
remote: Processing python-magic-0.4.3.1.tar.gz
remote: Running python-magic-0.4.3.1/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-ZRVMBg/python-magic-0.4.3.1/egg-dist-tmp-R_Nxie
remote: zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
remote: Removing python-magic 0.4.3 from easy-install.pth file
remote: Adding python-magic 0.4.3.1 to easy-install.pth file
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations! Your hotfix package has just been deployed.</p>

<p>This approach should work for other cloud providers and other programming languages
as well. Let me know if you have any experience with that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/startup/deed.jpg" alt="Deed" style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ideedit.com/">Deed</a> is an action-provoking platform for challenging
yourself and others and also a business solution for improved engagement by the
corresponding communities. It solves the problem of passivity by converting people
who “Like” to people who “Act. The challenge format gives businesses an effective,
fresh and low-cost solution to maintain active connection with their communities
and measure engagement.</p>

<p>Emil Stoychev explains their technical background.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Deed is built around Microsoft technologies plus some open source libraries.</p>

<p>Their web application and API is built with ASP.NET MVC 3 using MS SQL 2008 database engine.
Deed is hosted on a single cloud server at Rackspace and uses Akamai CDN for static files
distribution. At the moment the team is testing Windows Azure cloud platform and plans
migrating there.</p>

<p>A native Windows Phone application also exists.</p>

<p>Lots of JavaScript and CSS frameworks come to play at the  web interface layer like
jQuery, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> for templates and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a>.</p>

<p>IDE of choice is Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for C# and Vim for everything else.
Source code revision control is managed with Mercurial and build scripts are written in Python.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<blockquote><p>The Deed team had experience with Microsoft technologies initially so it was natural<br/>for us to choose this stack. While not perfect and costly in terms of hosting fees,<br/>it serves its purpose for the moment. When you start a new project and you want to get<br/>up and running fast your best choice is to use what you already mastered.<br/>That in our case was the Microsoft stack.</p><footer><strong>Emil Stoychev</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Indeed I strongly support this! Always use technologies you are a master at and change and
adapt along the way if necessary.</p>

<h2>Want More Info?</h2>

<p>If you’d like to hear more from <em>Deed</em> please comment below.
I will ask them to follow this thread and reply to your questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s Friday - five days after the first <a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI</a>
event was held. I have some interesting statistics derived from the
source code of all projects. Read on!</p>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi2013_cocomo.png" title="HackFMI stats" alt="&quot;HackFMI stats&quot;" /></p>

<h2>How The Stats Were Calculated</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://ohloh.net">Ohloh</a> to analyze the source code of all projects.
A simple Ohloh project called <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013">HackFMI 2013</a>
enlists and tracks <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013/enlistments">18</a>
different repositories as if they were one big project.
Not all teams had repositories and some didn&#8217;t sent information back to me although
I asked them. Two projects sent me tarballs with their code, which I&#8217;ve pushed to GitHub
for the purpose of tracking stats.</p>

<p>Be aware however that Ohloh is known to produce inaccurate statistics for projects
with lots of code and short development history. Furthermore its
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013/estimated_cost">COCOMO</a> calculations
are wrong as well due to duplicate code,
not written during the hackaton such as jQuery or PHP libraries.</p>

<h2>The Stats</h2>

<p>During the weekend sprint <strong>759,453 lines of code</strong> were written by
<strong>56 contributors</strong> spread across <strong>768 commits</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi2013_top_contributors.png" title="HackFMI top contributors" alt="&quot;HackFMI top contributors&quot;" /></p>

<p>From the top 10 contributors 5 had Python as their primary language.
Which is to say Python developers have good development practices with Git.</p>

<p>None of the contributors (excluding myself) were recognized by Ohloh,
meaning either they have not contributed to any other open source project
or their contributors were not under their name or
they&#8217;ve used a different name/email combination. Whatever the case go
claim your contributions and track your kudos rank across the open source community.</p>

<p><strong>19 different</strong> programming languages
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013/analyses/latest/languages_summary#dingus-row">were used</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi2013_languages.png" title="HackFMI top languages" alt="&quot;HackFMI top languages&quot;" /></p>

<p>The most popular ones are XML, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS and ActionScript. This is nearly 97%
of the source code. All the rest languages have been used under 1% per language.
The languages used are pretty standard and expected.</p>

<h2>Estimated Cost</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013/estimated_cost">estimated development cost</a>
is 205 person-years valued at $ 11,251,680. This is too high because of all duplicated
libraries and extra files tracked.</p>

<p>Ohloh allows files and directories to be excluded on per-repository basis.
I&#8217;d appreciate your help if you preview the projects and create the exclusion rules. Thanks!</p>

<p>The stats and repositories are public. If you manage to extract other interesting details

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Bulgarian translators team behind
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> asked for help some time ago
on a local mailing list. I promised to help but had nearly forgotten about that.
The guys are no developers, they simply wanted a script which will give them information
if a particular video has Bulgarian subtitles and the completion percentage.</p>

<p>They gave me a spread sheet file with a list of video URLs (3000 + of them).
Using Python&#8217;s <em>BeautifulSoup</em> module I hacked a small script to produce the
desired output.
Everything can be found at <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/Khan-Academy-Find-Subtitles">https://github.com/atodorov/Khan-Academy-Find-Subtitles</a>.</p>

<p>The script is very fresh, just run it today against the given input and produced
some results. Lots of the URLs were skipped, around 500 entries produced results,
100 more failed. I have no idea what happened to the rest.</p>

<p>This is an ideal side project for students (I&#8217;m looking at you #HackFMI participants)
which will teach you something about screen scraping and extracting data from
the web. It will also boost your karma by helping a project which
lacks developers but is open source in nature.</p>

<p>If you have some Python skills and would like to help please ping me as I
may not have the time to maintain this project in the long term.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi_beer.jpg" alt="HackFMI" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p>The first <a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI</a> event is now over :(. It was HUGE!
Kudos to the organizers, sponsors, mentors and all teams who took part and worked hard during
the weekend.</p>

<p>More than 100 people participated. There were 22 different teams presenting at the
finale yesterday evening. That in my opinion counts as a BIG success. I was surprised
to see so many people, lots of them first and second year at the university. There were
a good number of female hackers too, which I also didn&#8217;t expect.
<em>DISCLAIMER: I&#8217;ve graduated a different university where the culture and male/female ratio
was different so my expectations were biased.</em></p>

<p>People had interesting ideas and were passionate about them. They set off hacking
on a big scale. At times they wanted to create too big of an application and had to
cut off some features due to time constraints.</p>

<p>Congrats to all of them and hopefully they continue hacking!</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to talk to all the teams nor stay at the event full time but here is
how I saw things.</p>

<p>Organization was perfect. The best organized non-commercial local event I&#8217;ve seen in years.
There was food, beverages, T-shirts, even beer :). There were six big IT companies
<a href="http://hackfmi.com/sponsors-and-partners/">sponsoring</a> the
event. All of these are successful Bulgarian born companies.
Let that serve as an example!</p>

<p>The faculty was supporting the event too.
There were API and SQL dump for the teams to use. The entire building was open
during the weekend and during the night. Teams were able to make use of many rooms.
From what I know some of the successful ideas will be implemented into the faculty
administration as well. All of this is a first time and quite unexpected for a
Bulgarian university. I smell the wind of change already.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>My technology view of the event is limited to the teams I&#8217;ve mentored explicitly and the ones
I happened to walk by and interfere with. Naturally I gravitated around 4 teams using
Django and found two teams using PHP.</p>

<p>Django guys were doing well despite one of the teams not having any experience with it.
Most of the applications were such that didn&#8217;t require extensive knowledge of Django internals
but require mere programming of all features they wanted to implement.</p>

<p>What stroked me is that folks were making their database models too complicated.
I stumbled across two use cases in different teams where they wanted to have
one to many or many to many relationships. I strongly advised against this.
Hopefully they will remember.</p>

<p>Django makes schema design a child&#8217;s play and probably this is why lots of people
abuse and misuse that. My advise is keep the database as simple as possible
and move everything up the application layer. It&#8217;s easier to change and to maintain
that way. Not to mention experienced DBAs are hard to find.</p>

<p><strong>Keep the DB simple and know your tools well! </strong></p>

<p>With PHP the case was pretty much the same. Guys had some extra fields in their DB schema
which were unnecessary. They also wanted to abuse the data types of the DB and not use native types.</p>

<p>All of these technological misunderstandings are coming from inexperience, I know.
To get a closer look at why it is important to have a simple schema look at:
<a href="http://ontwik.com/python/disqus-scaling-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-django-application/">Disqus: Scaling the World’s Largest Django Application</a></p>

<h2>The Hackers</h2>

<p>During one of the breaks I was outside and one of the mentors complained that
ideas were pretty much standard. No screen scraping for additional information,
no mashing up, no revolutionary ideas. Everybody was using the provided API and
SQL dumps. Well almost.</p>

<p>One of my favorite <a href="https://github.com/vcrazy/project-6">teams</a> set off to
write a PHP robot which will automatically login and extract information from
SUSI (the faculty information system). Unfortunately that didn&#8217;t work so they
had to abandon it. They didn&#8217;t known <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>
and there was not enough time to
try and hack some browser side extension which will do the trick but they promised
to try it.</p>

<p>Because of their unorthodox approach from the start they became my personal favorites
and received Red Hat swag from me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi2013_team_six_rh_swag.jpg" title="Team Six" alt="Team Six" />
Adrian and Vihren are Team Six!</p>

<h2>What I didn&#8217;t like</h2>

<p>I didn&#8217;t like the fact that there was lots of duplicate work and ideas. Only one team
built a mobile application based on API and services provided by another team.</p>

<p>I suggest there&#8217;s a #hackfmi IRC channel next time so that people can communicate
with each other and focus on building great apps not reinventing the wheel.
<strong>Use IRC, you are hackers!</strong></p>

<p>What I was missing is that nobody proposed a pure cloud or big data application.
I don&#8217;t know if there was enough data provided by the faculty for such kind of
ideas, probably there wasn&#8217;t. Maybe next time there will be.</p>

<h2>Ohloh Stats</h2>

<p>While not participating actively except for a few hours of mentoring I found a
way to contribute. Many of the projects repositories are listed under
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013">https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013</a> which provides some interesting insight
and stats.</p>

<p>The list is incomplete. Lots of teams didn&#8217;t have any GitHub repos
or didn&#8217;t push the code recently. I will be contacting all of them in the next few days
and hopefully we will have a more accurate statistics by the end of the week.
Expect a separate blog post about it.</p>

<p>If you missed this event you should be sorry. <a href="/blog/2013/03/24/upcoming-hackatons-in-sofia/">You were warned</a>!
If you attended please share your experience with me. What you liked, what you didn&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora (or compatible) system execute</p>

<pre><code>$ vim example.spec
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new file with all the important sections and fields
already there. The template used is <code>/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/template.spec</code>
and is part of the <em>vim-common</em> RPM package.</p>

<p>This is very useful trick which I didn&#8217;t know. Until now I always used the spec files
from previously built packages when creating new RPMs. This wasn&#8217;t as fast as
creating a template and filling in the blanks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meisterplus.com/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8">MaistorPlus</a>
solves the common problem of finding a reliable builder or handyman.
An online platform that brings master craftsmen and homeowners together.</p>

<p>The process is really easy. Homeowners post jobs on the website and receive
offers from relevant tradesmen. After the job is done homeowners leave feedback
and recommendations. With this feature homeowners can compare tradesmen profiles,
offers and ratings and confidently choose who they want to hire.</p>

<p>The team is also runner up at the Start IT Smart
<a href="http://www.3challenge.com/startups/season-3/">3Challenge</a>.
<a href="http://meisterplus.com/about/team">Boris Sanchez</a> shared their technical mojo.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Main technologies used are PHP, Symfony 2.1 and PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>MaistorPlus is a traditional web platform developed with the
<a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony framework</a>. Web pages are rendered by Twig -
a straightforward, flexible and easy to extend templating engine, which is
integrated into the Symfony framework by default and works server-side with PHP
in order to generate dynamic content, based on data stored in the database.
Web pages also use jQuery and <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle.js</a> and feature modern graphics.
Everything is beautifully styled with CSS.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else</h2>

<blockquote><p>The original development team already had experience with Symfony, Zend, Spring and<br/>some other web application development frameworks. We opted for Symfony for two<br/>main reasons. First, Symfony is constantly improving, and has a strong and<br/>continuously growing community that offers 3rd party add-on components for free.<br/>Second, PHP is a bit easier to &#8220;learn as you go&#8221; then Java. The members of our<br/>design team didn&#8217;t have a lot of prior programming experience, so we wanted to<br/>make sure we set a low barrier of entry for them, as we didn&#8217;t have the enough<br/>development staff to have a distinct separation between design creation and design<br/>integration in our team.</p><p>For the initial prototype we used the MySQL database management system. After a<br/>while we wanted to add spatial features to the business logic, and discovered that<br/>MySQL does not have proper support for spatial indexing. We therefore decided to<br/>migrate to PostgreSQL, which supports spatial data with add-ons like PostGIS.</p><footer><strong>Boris Sanchez</strong></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did you ever have to re-purpose a column in your database schema?
Here&#8217;s a quick and easy way to do this if you happen to be using Django.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I had an integer field in my model called <code>lines</code> which counted the lines of
code in a particular tar.gz package. I figured the file size is a better indicator
so decided to start using it. I was not planning to use the old field anymore and
I didn&#8217;t care about the data it was holding. So I decided to re-purpose it
as the <code>size</code> field.</p>

<h2>Possible methods</h2>

<p>Looking around I figured several different ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Continue using the existing <code>lines</code> field and keep referencing the old name in the code.
This is no-brainer but feels awkward and is a disaster waiting to happen;</li>
<li>Add new <code>size</code> field and remove the old <code>lines</code> field. This involves modification to
the DB schema and requires at least a backup with possible down time. Not something
I will jump at right away;</li>
<li>Add a <code>size</code> property in the model class which will persist to <code>self.lines</code>.
This is a quick way to go but I&#8217;m not sure if one can use the property with the
Django QuerySet API (objects.filter(), objects.update(), etc.) I suspect not.
If you don&#8217;t filter by the property or use it in bulk operations this method is fine though;</li>
<li>Change the field name to <code>size</code> but continue to use the <code>lines</code> DB column;
Mind my wording here :);</li>
<li>Rename the column in the DB schema and then update the model class field.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How I did it</h2>

<p>I decided to go for option 4 above:
change the field name to <code>size</code> but continue to use the <code>lines</code> DB column.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='diff'><span class='line'><span class="gh">diff --git a/models.py b/models.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gh">index e06d2b2..18cad6f 100644</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gd">--- a/models.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gi">+++ b/models.py</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gu">@@ -667,7 +667,7 @@ class Package(models.Model):</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gd">-    lines = models.IntegerField(default=None, null=True, blank=True)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gi">+    size  = models.IntegerField(default=None, null=True, blank=True, db_column=&#39;lines&#39;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li>Removed all references to <code>lines</code> from the code except the model class. This served as clean up as well.</li>
<li>Renamed the model field to <code>size</code> but continued using the <code>lines</code> DB column as shown above.
Django&#8217;s <em>db_column</em> option makes this possible.</li>
<li>From the Django shell (./manage.py shell) reset <code>size</code> to None (NULL) for all objects;</li>
<li>Finally implement my new code and functionality behind the <code>size</code> field.</li>
</ol>


<p>The entire process happened for under 10 minutes. I will also opt for renaming the DB column at a later time.
This is to sync the naming used in Python code and in MySQL in case I ever need to use raw SQL or anything but Django.</p>

<p>If you were me, how would you do this? Please share in the comments below.</p>

<p><a href="http://ucha.se/">Ucha.se</a> makes learning fun. It is an online platform,
on which pupils and students learn and prepare for school. Pupils learn faster,
improve their results and get inspired. The platform allows students to watch
videos, take tests, ask questions and share comments. Learning is represented
with gamification components like drawings, playful narration, dashboards with
the best students, etc. It is available on the web and is extending to mobile.
Ucha.se is well recognized by the parents and teachers in Bulgaria.
In November 2012 Ucha.se was awarded as the best website in Bulgaria in the
field of Education and Science.</p>

<p>Nikolay Zheynov is leading the IT team which maintains and expands the web platform.
He shared with me some of the internals.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Main technologies used are PHP, MySQL, Nginx, jQuery and jQueryUI.</p>

<p>Server-side development is done with PHP 5. The main reason for choosing PHP is
that the IT team working on the platform had long experience with the language.
Ucha.se has developed their own PHP framework which is constantly expanding.
This allows flexible programming and easier application maintenance.
Nginx is the web server of choice.</p>

<p>MySQL 5 is used for the database because PHP + MySQL is like bread and butter.
While the site usage was growing the team had to optimize their DB layer and switched
from MyISAM storage engine to InnoDB.</p>

<p>On the client-side standard web technologies are used - HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The main goal when doing the website design was to match expectation from different
user groups - pupils, teachers, parents and students.
jQuery and jQueryUI are widely used on the client side.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<blockquote><p>True to our agile approach to incrementally enhance the product and the technology<br/>that goes along with it, we strongly believe in the scaling on demand practices.<br/>Ucha.se&#8217;s own framework reflects exactly to that. It allows us to meet our growing<br/>user demands and provides at the same time, the dev-team with enough flexibility to<br/>quickly react on new business opportunities and technological (r)evolutions.</p><footer><strong>Nikolay Zheynov</strong></footer></blockquote>

KBGB 3864 refrigerator, caused by what looks like a race-condition.</p>

<p>This appliance starts beeping in case the door is left open for more than 60 seconds.
The alarm stops if door is closed or can be muted manually while the door is still open.</p>

<h2>The Bug</h2>

<p>It happened so that I had the door open for nearly one minute and as it was closing
I heard a beep. This time however the beeping didn&#8217;t stop after the door had closed.
The alarm continued beeping with the door closed so I tried to re-open and close it again.
It didn&#8217;t stop! I had to open the door and manually mute the alarm for it to stop.</p>

<div style="display:block; clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>The Root Cause</h2>

<p>While not entirely sure, I think the reason for this malfunction
was a race-condition. The alarm went on at nearly the same time when the
controlling timer should have gone off (when closing the door).</p>

<h2>Steps To Reproduce</h2>

<p>I tried reproducing several times afterwards by opening and closing the door
at the last possible moment. I used a stop-watch to time my actions. However
I wasn&#8217;t able to reproduce twice. Every time I tried, there was only one single
beep as the door was closing and no more.</p>

<p>I guess then, like we say in QE, <em>WORKS FOR ME</em>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="/images/startup/usefulatnight.png" alt="Useful at Night logo" /></p>

<p><a href="http://usefulatnight.com/">Useful at Night</a> is a mobile guide for nightlife
empowering real time discovery of cool locations, allowing nightlife players
to identify opinion leaders. Through geo-location and data aggregation
capabilities, the application allows useful exploration of cities, places and
parties.</p>

<p><a href="http://about.me/velev">Evelin Velev</a> was kind enough to share what technologies
his team uses to run their star-up.</p>

<br/>


<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Main technologies used are Node.js, HTML 5 and NoSQL.</p>

<p>Back-end application servers are written in Node.js and hosted at Heroku,
coupled with <a href="http://www.redistogo.com/">RedisToGo</a> for caching and
CouchDB served by <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> for storage.</p>

<p>Their mobile front-end supports both iOS and Android platforms and is built using
HTML5 and a homemade UI framework called RAPID. There are some native parts developed
in Objective-C and Java respectively.</p>

<p>In addition <em>Useful at Night</em> uses MongoDB for metrics data with a custom metrics solution
written in Node.js; Amazon S3 for storing different assets; and a custom storage solution
called Divan (simple CouchDB like).</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<blockquote><p>We chose Node.js for our application servers, because it enables us to build efficient<br/>distributed systems while sharing significant amounts of code between client and server.<br/>Things get really interesting when you couple Node.js with Redis for data structure<br/>sharing and message passing, as the two technologies play very well together.</p><p>We chose CouchDB as our main back-end because it is the most schema-less data-store that<br/>supports secondary indexing. Once you get fluent with its map-reduce views, you can<br/>compute an index out of practically anything. For comparison, even MongoDB requires<br/>that you design your documents as to enable certain indexing patterns. Put otherwise,<br/>we&#8217;d say CouchDB is a data-store that enables truly lean engineering - we have never had<br/>to re-bake or migrate our data since day one, while we&#8217;re constantly experimenting with<br/>new ways to index, aggregate and query it.</p><p>We chose HTML5 as our front-end technology, because it&#8217;s cross-platform and because we<br/>believe it&#8217;s &#8230; almost ready. Things are still really problematic on Android, but iOS<br/>boasts a gorgeous web presentation platform, and Windows 8 is also joining the game with<br/>a very good web engine. Obviously we&#8217;re constantly running into issues and limitations,<br/>mostly related to the unfortunate fact that in spite of some recent developments,<br/>a web app is still mostly single threaded. However, we&#8217;re getting there, and we&#8217;re proud<br/>to say we&#8217;re running a pretty graphically complex hybrid app with near-native GUI performance<br/>on the iPhone 4S and above.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am starting a new section called
<a href="/blog/categories/what-runs/">What Runs Your Start-up</a> where I will
write about the technologies running behind some interesting
start-up companies and why they made their technological choices.
The articles will be short and to the point. Interested readers
can engage in discussion with start-up owners in the comments later.</p>

<p>I am starting with a dozen companies from the Bulgarian start-up eco-system
and will present one or two start-ups per week.
If you&#8217;d like to read about a company which is not listed here or want to
promote your own just let me know.</p>
