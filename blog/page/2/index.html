  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I figured out that
<a href="/blog/2014/11/11/speeding-up-celery-backends-part-3/">Celery is rather slow</a>
I moved on to test another part of my environment - a web proxy server.
The test here compares two proxy
<a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/666035d270d97d982cd5">implementations</a>
- one with Python Twisted,
the other in Go. The backend is a simple web server written in Go, which is
probably the fastest thing when it comes to serving HTML.</p>

<p>The test content is a snapshot of the front page of this blog taken few days ago.
The system is a standard Lenovo X220 laptop, with Intel Core i7 CPU, with 4 cores.
The measurement instrument is the popular wrk tool with a
<a href="/blog/2014/11/18/proxy-support-for-wrk-http-benchmarking-tool/">custom Lua script to redirect the requests through the proxy</a>.</p>

<p>All tests were repeated several times, only the best results are shown here.
I&#8217;ve taken time between the tests in order for all open TCP ports to close.
I&#8217;ve also observed the number of open ports (e.g. sockets) using <code>netstat</code>.</p>

<h2>Baseline</h2>

<p>Using wrk against the web server in Go yields around 30000 requests per second
with an average of 2000 TCP ports in use:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./wrk -c1000 -t20 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html
Running 30s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html

  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev

    Req/Sec     1.72k     2.45k   17.63k    88.70%
  1016810 requests in 29.97s, 34.73GB read
  Non-2xx or 3xx responses: 685544
Requests/sec:  33928.41
Transfer/sec:      1.16GB
</code></pre>

<h2>Python Twisted</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/666035d270d97d982cd5">Twisted implementation</a>
performs at little over 1000 reqs/sec with an average TCP port use between 20000 and 30000:</p>

<pre><code>./wrk -c1000 -t20 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080 -s scripts/proxy.lua -- http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html

    Req/Sec   104.14     72.19   335.00     55.94%
  40449 requests in 30.02s, 3.67GB read
  Socket errors: connect 0, read 0, write 0, timeout 8542
  Non-2xx or 3xx responses: 5382
Requests/sec:   1347.55
Transfer/sec:    125.12MB
</code></pre>

<h2>Go proxy</h2>

<p>First I&#8217;ve run several 30 seconds tests and performance was around 8000 req/sec
with around 20000 ports used (most of them remain in TIME_WAIT state for a while).
Then I&#8217;ve modified <code>proxy.go</code> to make use of all available CPUs on the system and let
the test run for 5 minutes.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./wrk -c1000 -t20 -d300s http://127.0.0.1:9090 -s scripts/proxy.lua -- http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html
Running 5m test @ http://127.0.0.1:9090
  20 threads and 1000 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency   137.22ms  437.95ms   4.45s    97.55%
    Req/Sec   669.54    198.52     1.71k    76.40%
  3423108 requests in 5.00m, 58.27GB read
  Socket errors: connect 0, read 26, write 181, timeout 24268
  Non-2xx or 3xx responses: 2870522
Requests/sec:  11404.19
Transfer/sec:    198.78MB
</code></pre>

<p>Performance peaked at 10000 req/sec. TCP port usage initially rose to around 30000
but rapidly dropped and stayed around 3000. Both <code>webserver.go</code> and <code>proxy.go</code> were
printing the following messages on the console:</p>

<pre><code>2014/11/18 21:53:06 http: Accept error: accept tcp [::]:9090: too many open files; retrying in 1s
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that Go is blazingly fast compared to Python and I&#8217;m most likely to use it
further in my experiments. Still I didn&#8217;t expect a 3x difference in performance from webserver vs. proxy.</p>

<p>Another thing that worries me is the huge number of open TCP ports which then drops and stays
consistent over time and the error messages from both webserver and proxy (maybe per process sockets limit).</p>

<p>At the moment I&#8217;m not aware of the internal workings of neither wrk, nor
Go itself, nor the goproxy library to make conclusion if this is a bad thing or expected.
I&#8217;m eager to hear what others think in the comments. Thanks!</p>

<h2>Update 2015-01-27</h2>

<p>I have retested with PyPy but on a different system so I&#8217;m giving all the test results
on it as well. <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> says we have 16 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2450L 0 @ 1.80GHz
CPUs.</p>

<p>As seen Go proxy is slower than the Go server by factor of 2.
Python proxy is slower by than the Go server by factor of 20.
These results are similar to previous ones so I don&#8217;t think PyPy
makes any significant difference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Few times recently I&#8217;ve seen people using an HTTP benchmarking tool called
<a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> and decided to give it a try. It is a very cool
instrument but didn&#8217;t fit my use case perfectly. What I needed is to be able to
redirect the connection through a web proxy and measure how much the proxy
slows down things compared to hitting the web server directly with wrk.
In other words - how fast is the proxy server.</p>

<h2>How does a proxy work</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve examined the source code of two proxies (one in Python and another one in Go)
and what happens is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The proxy server starts listening to a TCP port</li>
<li>A client (e.g. the browser) sends the request using an absolute URL (GET http://example.com/about.html)</li>
<li>Instead of connecting directly to the web server behind example.com the client connects to the proxy</li>
<li>The proxy server does connect to example.com directly, reads the response and delivers it back to
the client.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Proxy in wrk</h2>

<p>Luckily wrk supports the execution of Lua scripts so we can make a
<a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk/pull/107">simple script</a> like this:</p>

<pre><code>init = function(args)
    target_url = args[1] -- proxy needs absolute URL
end

request = function()
    return wrk.format("GET", target_url)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then update your command line to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>./wrk [options] http://proxy:port -s proxy.lua -- http://example.com/about.html
</code></pre>

<p>This causes wrk to connect to our proxy server but instead issue GET requests for another URL.
Depending on how your proxy works you may need to add the <code>Host: example.com</code> header as well.
Now let&#8217;s do some testing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ten days ago the regular <a href="http://hackfmi.com/">HackFMI</a> competition was held.
This year they tried sending SMS notifications to all participants which was powered
by <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> both in terms of infrastructure and cost.</p>

<p><strong>Twilio</strong> provided a <strong>20$ upgrade code</strong> valid in the next 6 months for all new accounts.
This was officially announced at the opening ceremony (although at the last possible time) of the
competition, however no teams decided to incorporate SMS/Voice into their games.
I&#8217;m a little disappointed by this fact.</p>

<p>In terms of software a simple <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/django-twilio-sms">Django app</a>
was used. It is by no means production ready but does the job and was quick to write.</p>

<p>A little over 300 messages were sent with number distribution as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mtel - 166</li>
<li>Globul - 86</li>
<li>Vivacom - 50</li>
</ul>


<p>The total price for Mtel and Globul messages is roughly the same because sending
SMS to Globul via Twilio is as twice expensive. The total sums up to about 25 $.
HackFMI team used two accounts to send the messages - one using the provided
20$ upgrade code from Twilio and the second one was mine.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the second part of this article we&#8217;ve seen
<a href="/blog/2014/11/07/speeding-up-celery-backends-part-2/">how slow Celery actually is</a>.
Now let&#8217;s explore what happens inside and see if we can&#8217;t speed things up.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/latest/">pycallgraph</a> to create
call graph visualizations of my application. It has the nice feature to also show
execution time and use different colors for fast and slow operations.</p>

<p>Full command line is:</p>

<pre><code>pycallgraph -v --stdlib --include ... graphviz -o calls.png -- ./manage.py celery_load_test
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>--include</code> is used to limit the graph to a particular Python module(s).</p>

<h2>General findings</h2>

<p><img src="/images/celery/general.png" title="call graph" alt="call graph" /></p>

<ul>
<li>The first four calls is where most of the time is spent as seen on the picture.</li>
<li>As it seems most of the slow down comes from Celery itself, not the underlying messaging
transport Kombu (not shown on picture)</li>
<li><code>celery.app.amqp.TaskProducer.publish_task</code> takes half of the execution time of
<code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code></li>
<li><code>celery.app.task.Task.delay</code> directly executes <code>.apply_async</code> and can be skipped if one
rewrites the code.</li>
</ul>


<h2>More findings</h2>

<p>In <code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code> there is this block of code:</p>

<pre><code>349         with self.producer_or_acquire(producer) as P:
350             self.backend.on_task_call(P, task_id)
351             task_id = P.publish_task(
352                 name, args, kwargs, countdown=countdown, eta=eta,
353                 task_id=task_id, expires=expires,
354                 callbacks=maybe_list(link), errbacks=maybe_list(link_error),
355                 reply_to=reply_to or self.oid, **options
356             )
</code></pre>

<p><code>producer</code> is always None because delay() doesn&#8217;t pass it as argument.
I&#8217;ve tried passing it explicitly to apply_async() as so:</p>

<pre><code>from djapp.celery import *

# app = debug_task._get_app() # if not defined in djapp.celery
producer = app.amqp.producer_pool.acquire(block=True)
debug_task.apply_async(producer=producer)
</code></pre>

<p>However this doesn&#8217;t speedup anything. If we replace the above code block like this:</p>

<pre><code>349         with producer as P:
</code></pre>

<p>it blows up on the second iteration because producer and its channel is already None !?!</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with the with statement in Python please read
<a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm">this article</a>. In short the with statement is
a compact way of writing try/finally. The underlying <code>kombu.messaging.Producer</code> class does a
<code>self.release()</code> on exit of the with statement.</p>

<p>I also tried killing the with statement and using producer directly but with limited success. While
it was not released(was non None) on subsequent iterations the memory usage grew much more and there
wasn&#8217;t any performance boost.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The with statement is used throughout both Celery and Kombu and I&#8217;m not at all sure if
there&#8217;s a mechanism for keep-alive connections. My time constraints are limited and I&#8217;ll probably
not spend anymore time on this problem soon.</p>

<p>Since my use case involves task producer and consumers on localhost I&#8217;ll try to workaround the
current limitations by using Kombu directly
(see <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">this gist</a>) with a transport that
uses either a UNIX domain socket or a name pipe (FIFO) file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">first part</a> of this
post I looked at a few celery backends and discovered they didn&#8217;t meet my needs.
Why is the Celery stack slow? How slow is it actually?</p>

<h2>How slow is Celery in practice</h2>

<ul>
<li>Queue: 500`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Kombu:  14`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Celery:  2`000 msg/sec</li>
</ul>


<h2>Detailed test description</h2>

<p>There are three main components of the Celery stack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Celery itself</li>
<li>Kombu which handles the transport layer</li>
<li>Python Queue()&#8217;s underlying everything</li>
</ul>


<p>Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">Queue and Kombu tests</a>
run for 1 000 000 messages I got the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Raw Python Queue: Msgs per sec: 500`000</li>
<li>Raw Kombu without Celery where <code>kombu/utils/__init__.py:uuid()</code> is set to return 0

<ul>
<li>with json serializer: Msgs per sec: 5`988</li>
<li>with pickle serializer: Msgs per sec: 12`820</li>
<li>with the custom mem_serializer from <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">part 1</a>:
Msgs per sec: 14`492</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> when the test is executed with 100K messages mem_serializer yielded
25`000 msg/sec then the performance is saturated. I&#8217;ve observed similar behavior
with raw Python Queue()&#8217;s. I saw some cache buffers being managed internally to avoid OOM
exceptions. This is probably the main reason performance becomes saturated over a longer
execution.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a> modified to
loop 1 000 000 times I got 1908.0 tasks created per sec.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another interesting this worth outlining - in the kombu test there are these lines:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>with producers[connection].acquire(block=True) as producer:
</span><span class='line'>    for j in range(1000000):</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we swap them the performance drops down to 3875 msg/sec which is comparable with the
Celery results. Indeed inside Celery there&#8217;s the same <code>with producer.acquire(block=True)</code>
construct which is executed every time a new task is published. Next I will be looking
into this to figure out exactly where the slowliness comes from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on an application which fires a lot of Celery tasks - the more
the better! Unfortunately Celery backends seem to be rather slow :(.
Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a>
command for Django I was able to capture some metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon SQS backend: 2 or 3 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Filesystem backend: 2000 - 2500 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Memory backend: around 3000 tasks/sec</li>
</ul>


<p>Not bad but I need in the order of 10000 tasks created per sec!
The other noticeable thing is that memory backend isn&#8217;t much faster compared to
the filesystem one! NB: all of these backends actually come from the kombu package.</p>

<h2>Why is Celery slow ?</h2>

<p>Using <code>celery_load_test.py</code> together with
<a href="/blog/2014/11/05/performance-profiling-in-python-with-cprofile/">cProfile</a> I
was able to pin-point some problematic areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kombu/transports/virtual/__init__.py</code>: class Channel.basic_publish() - does
self.encode_body() into base64 encoded string. Fixed with custom transport backend
I called fastmemory which redefines the body_encoding property:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'>    <span class="nd">@cached_property</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">body_encoding</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Celery uses json or pickle (or other) serializers to serialize the data.
While json yields between 2000-3000 tasks/sec, pickle does around 3500 tasks/sec.
Replacing with a custom serializer which just returns
the objects (since we read/write from/to memory) yields about 4000 tasks/sec tops:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">kombu.serialization</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">register</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><code>kombu/utils/__init__.py</code>: def uuid() - generates random unique identifiers
which is a slow operation. Replacing it with <code>return "00000000"</code> boosts performance
to 7000 tasks/sec.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s clear that a constant UUID is not of any practical use but serves well to illustrate
how much does this function affect performance.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Subsequent executions of <code>celery_load_test</code> seem to report degraded performance even with
the most optimized transport backend. I&#8217;m not sure why is this. One possibility is the random
UUID usage in other parts of the Celery/Kombu stack which drains entropy on the system and
generating more random numbers becomes slower. If you know better please tell me!</p>

<p>I will be looking for a better understanding
of these IDs in Celery and hope to be able to produce a faster uuid() function. Then I&#8217;ll be
exploring the transport stack even more in order to reach the goal of 10000 tasks/sec.
If you have any suggestions or pointers please share them in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prompted by <a href="http://radorado.me/">Rado&#8217;s</a> post about
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/radorado.radoslav.georgiev/posts/10204276374941470">Mtel not fixing a business customer Internet connection</a>
I want to tell you a story about how the big company totally fucked up their
online invoice system and give you a few more hints about how stupidity
reigns supreme even in big companies, especially in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never received a paper invoice for my phone bill and used the website to access any information
about my bills and calls duration, etc. The problem is that I ported my number to another operator.</p>

<p><strong>Porting a number away from Mtel automatically cuts access to your previous invoices online</strong></p>

<h2>The problem in technical terms</h2>

<p>This is a tech blog so let&#8217;s be technical. Users can register at Mtel&#8217;s website via
username and password. If they are customers then they can add their numbers to their
profile. Once the number is verified (via SMS code), the user has access to additional services
one of which is online invoices and monthly usage reports.</p>

<p>Migrating away to another operator &#8220;erases&#8221; your number from the system but
this is not true actually. All the information is still there because they can give me
print outs if I pay all the extra fees and simply because no business will voluntarily
erase their database records.</p>

<p><strong>The genius who designed the <em>if-number-migrated-then-delete-from-user-profile-and-cut-off-access</em>
business process/software implementation is the biggest idiot in the world.</strong></p>

<h2>How Mtel handled my complaint</h2>

<p>My request for
explanation (see below) was answered with a nice letter, basically telling me to piss off. None of my
questions were answered. To make things worse they want to charge extra fees for detailed print outs.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve asked for:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be granted access back to all of my invoices online. Not only I paid for them but this
is something of a personal information;</li>
<li>To be given copies of my last 5 invoices, preferably via email;</li>
<li>To be given explanation why my online access to previous invoices was cut off;</li>
<li>Mtel to stop doing this and allow access to online invoices for everyone of their past
or current customers;</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve also told them I&#8217;m available to help them fix their system if they don&#8217;t have
the resources to do so (hint, hint: it&#8217;s an if-then condition or something very close I bet).</p>

<p>A copy of my complaint and the response to it (in Bulgarian only):</p>

<p><img src="/images/mtel/complaint_01.jpg" title="Complaint" alt="&quot;Complaint&quot;" />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A month ago one of my startups Difio stopped working forever.
This is the story of how to go about shutting down a working
web service and not about why it came around to this.</p>

<h2>Step #1: Disable new registrations</h2>

<p>You obviously need to make sure new customers
arriving at your web site will not sing up to only find the service is
shutting down later.</p>

<p>Disable whatever sign-on/registration system you have in place
but leave currently registered users to login as they wish.</p>

<h2>Step #2: Disable payments</h2>

<p>Difio had paying customers, just not enough of them and it was based on
a subscription model which was automatically renewed without any interaction
from the customer.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to disable all payments for the service which
was quite easy (just a few comments) because Difio used an external payment
processor.</p>

<p>Next thing was to go through all subscriptions that were still active and
cancel them. This prevented the payment processor to automatically charge
the customers next time their subscription renewal was due.</p>

<p>Because all subscriptions were charged in advance and when canceled were
still considered active (due to expire at some later date) Difio had to
keep operating at least one month after all subscriptions have been canceled.</p>

<h2>Step #3: Notify all customers that you are shutting down</h2>

<p>I scheduled this to happen right after the last subscription was canceled.
An email to everyone who registered to the website and a blog post should work
for most startups. See ours <a href="http://www.dif.io/blog/2014/08/10/difio-is-shutting-down/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to provide a gratis period if necessary. Difio had a gratis period
of one month after the shutdown announcement.</p>

<h2>Step #4: Disable all external triggers</h2>

<p>Difio was a complex piece of software which relied on external triggers like
web hooks and repetitive tasks executed by cron.</p>

<p>Disabling these will prevent external services or hosting providers
getting errors about your URLs not being accessible. It is just polite
to do so.</p>

<p>You may want to keep these still operational during the gratis period
before the physical shutdown or disable them straight away. In Difio&#8217;s
case they were left operational because there were customers who have paid
in advance and relied on this functionality.</p>

<h2>Step #5: Prepare your &#8216;Service Disabled&#8217; banner</h2>

<p>You will probably want to let people know why something isn&#8217;t working
as it used (or is expected) to be. A simple page explaining that
you&#8217;re going to shut down should be enough.</p>

<p>Difio required the user to be logged in to see most of the website.
This made it very easy to redirect everything to the same page.
A few more places were linking to public URLs which were manually rewritten
to point to the same &#8216;Service Disabled&#8217; page.</p>

<p>It is the same page used previously to redirect new registrations to.</p>

<h2>Step #6: Terminate all processing resources</h2>

<p>Difio used both AWS EC2 instances and an OpenShift PaaS instance to do its
processing. Simply terminating all of them was enough. The only thing left
is a couple of static HTML pages behind the domain.</p>

<h2>Step #7: Database archival</h2>

<p>The last thing you need to do is archive your database. Although the
startup is out of business already you have gathered additional information
which may come handy at a later time.</p>

<p>Difio didn&#8217;t collect any personal information about its users, except email
and didn&#8217;t store financial information either. This made it safe to just make
a backup of the database and leave it lurking around on disk.</p>

<p>However beware
if you have collected personal and/or financial information from your customers.
You may want to erase/anonymize some of it before doing your backups and
probably safeguard them from unauthorized access.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, your startup is officially dead now! Let me know if I&#8217;ve missed
something in the comments below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Viral Marketing</li>
<li>Public Relations (PR)</li>
<li>Unconventional PR</li>
<li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li>
<li>Social and Display Ads</li>
<li>Offline Ads</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Content Marketing</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Engineering as Marketing</li>

<p>The book is very easy to read and full of practical advice which should serve as a starting point and give you
more ideas how to approach a particular distribution channel. It took me two days to read and
I already had some ideas to test even before reading the whole of it. My next steps are to apply the principles
to my current startup <a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">Obuvki 41 Plus</a> and a future one I have in mind.</p>

<p>To anyone building a startup of any kind I would recommend the following selection of books:</p>

by Timothy Ferriss is one of my all time favorite books.
The basic idea is to ditch the traditional working environment
and work less utilizing more automation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.</p><footer><strong>MARK TWAIN</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>The book starts with a story about the Tango World Championship semifinals in
Argentina and poses the question
<em>“What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left my job and the U.S. over a year ago?”</em>
Can you answer this? Keep reading!</p>

<h2>Step 1: Definition</h2>

<p>Tim defines two groups of people. The Deferrers, those who save it all for the
end only to find that life has passed them by and the New Rich.</p>

<blockquote><p>* The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement<br/>  to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the time, which frees him to<br/>  practice cross-country skiing and take road trips with his family two weeks per<br/>  month.</p><p>* The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers and projects,<br/>  outsources all operations entirely, and travels the world collecting rare<br/>  documents, all while working remotely on a website to showcase her own<br/>  illustration work.</p><p>* The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to establish an online<br/>  video rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche<br/>  of Blu-ray aficionados, a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work<br/>  full-time as an animal rights lobbyist.</p></blockquote>


<p>The possibilities are endless. What defines the New Rich is their unrestricted mobility
and availability of free time! Money alone doesn&#8217;t count anymore. Its practical value is
multiplied by the <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>where</em> and with <em>whom</em> you do what you do.</p>

<p>From that point of view earning less money but spending far less time on that is
much more powerful than working 80 hours per week for a million dollars.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Elimination</h2>

<blockquote><p>One does not accumulate but eliminate.<br/>It is not daily increase but daily decrease.<br/>The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity.</p><footer><strong>BRUCE LEE</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>In this chapter Tim talks about developing selective ignorance of information,
the 80-20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>,
gives tips for faster reading and battling interruption like checking your e-mail
and smart phone.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Automation</h2>

<p>Outsourcing and technical automation are the keys here but there is more.
Tim talks about income autopilot - designing your income sources in such a way
so that they don&#8217;t consume much of your time and continue to produce income
even after the initial time investment.</p>

<p>Think about the following: working a 9-to-5 job yields an income only during
office hours. Having written a book yields income whenever a copy is sold, which
is while you&#8217;re asleep and long after the initial time investment required to
write the book.</p>

<p>Then you can diversify your income streams and voila - you&#8217;re making money
automatically :)</p>

<p>Tim also refers to the business management side of things. Why become the
manager when you can be the owner of the business ? It&#8217;s kind of hard to
let virtual assistants run your business and resolve issues for you but that
frees up your time which is more valuable.</p>

<p>In between he also mentions why as a business you should keep prices high!
Counter intuitive, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>This is easier said than done but I&#8217;ve been working on it for the last couple
of years and its starting to take shape nicely so there&#8217;s truth to it.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Liberation</h2>

<p>This is the chapter which helps you escape the 9-5 office hours through some
interesting techniques. This is not only for freelancers like myself but also
for the regular employee. One of the principles is to ask for forgiveness,
not a permission (which will be denied anyway).</p>

<p>Another one boils down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase company investment into you so that the loss is greater if you quit,
e.g. corporate training;</li>
<li>Prove increased output offsite - call in sick Tuesday to Thursday but continue
working. Produce more and leave some sort of digital trail, emails, etc;</li>
<li>Prepare the quantifiable business benefit - you need to present remote working
as a good business decision and not a personal perk, for example you&#8217;ve managed to
bill more hours to your company&#8217;s customers. As explanation use removal of commute
and fewer distractions from the office noise;</li>
<li>Propose a revocable trial period - plan everything that will be said but play it
cool and casual. You want to avoid the impression that remote working will be something
permanent (for now). Find a relaxed afternoon and give it a shot!</li>
<li>Expand remote time by making sure you&#8217;re most productive on your days out of the
office and if need be lower the productivity inside the office a bit. Then give it
a shot for a longer trial period or more days working remotely;</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s also another one called the hourglass approach, so named because you use a
long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote agreement and then negotiate
back up to full-time out of the office.</p>

<p>I personally had it easier in terms of remote working. Before I became a contractor
I&#8217;ve been working with folks in the US to whom it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether I was
based in Czech Republic or in Bulgaria. Also I&#8217;ve been sick at that time and had an
important project to manage which all just played nicely in proving that I
can be productive in any location.</p>

<p>Then comes one of my favorite sections <em>Killing Your Job</em>. Boy you just have to read
this. Lots of people need to read this! Everything you are afraid of and keeps you from
quitting your job is total bulshit. There are always options. It might be emotionally
difficult, but you won’t starve!</p>

<h2>Extended edition</h2>

<p>This extended edition of the book completes with blog articles and bonus sections
like <em>Killing Your BlackBerry</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. <br/>Been doing this for seven years. Prior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W<br/>(translate: work for work’s sake)<br/>&#8230;<br/>Crunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately<br/>began taking Mondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend.<br/>Tuesday to Friday I work 11 A.M.–4 P.M. (20 hours per week).<br/>&#8230;<br/>I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that<br/>50% of the 80% was pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone<br/>on my payroll.<br/>&#8230;<br/>I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync”.<br/>Now it’s on a Tues–Fri, 11 A.M.–4 P.M. schedule.<br/>&#8230;<br/>My e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending<br/>me meaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me.</p><footer><strong>ANDREW</strong> <cite>Self-employed in the UK</cite></footer></blockquote>

by Dale Carnegie teaches you how to deal with people. The book briefly explains
some easy to use principles, why and how they work and then provides tons of
real life examples behind those principles. This book is a must for everyone but

<p>I will only highlight the key points. What follows are direct quotes from the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a quick status update for one of the pieces of
<a href="/blog/2013/11/19/open-source-quality-assurance-infrastructure-for-fedora-qa/">Fedora QA infrastructure</a>
and mostly a self-note.</p>

<p>Previously to control the kickstart configuration used during installation in Beaker one
had to either modify the job XML in Beaker or use SNAKE (<code>bkr workflow-snake</code>) to render
a kickstart configuration from a Python template.</p>

<p>SNAKE presented challenges when deploying and using
<a href="https://beaker.fedoraproject.org">beaker.fedoraproject.org</a> and is
virtually unmaintained.</p>

<p>I present the new <code>bkr workflow-installer-test</code> which uses Jinja2 templates to
generate a kickstart configuration when provisioning the system. This is already
available in beaker-client-0.17.1.</p>

<p>The templates make use of all Jinja2 features (as far as I can tell) so you can create
very complex ones. You can even include snippets from one template into another if required.
The standard context that is passed to the template is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DISTRO</strong> - if specified, the distro name</li>
<li><strong>FAMILY</strong> - as returned by Beaker server, e.g. <em>RedHatEnterpriseLinux6</em></li>
<li><strong>OS_MAJOR</strong> and <strong>OS_MINOR</strong> - also taken from Beaker server. e.g. OS_MAJOR=6 and OS_MINOR=5 for RHEL 6.5</li>
<li><strong>VARIANT</strong> - if specified</li>
<li><strong>ARCH</strong> - CPU architecture like x86_64</li>
<li>any parameters passed to the test job with <code>--taskparam</code>. They are processed last and can override previous values.</li>
</ul>


<p>Installation related tests at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fedoraqa/fedora-beaker-tests">fedora-beaker-tests</a>
have been updated with a <code>ks.cfg.tmpl</code> templates to use with this new workflow.</p>

<p>This workflow also has the ability to return boot arguments for the installer if needed.
If any, they should be defined in a {% block kernel_options %}{% endblock %}
block inside the template. A simpler variant is to define a comment line that stars with
<em>## kernel_options:</em></p>

<p>There are still a few issues which need to be fixed before beaker.fedoraproject.org
can be used by the general public though. I will be writing another post about that
so stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my practice I like to use webhooks and integrate auxiliary services with
my internal processes or businesses. One of these is the collection of emails.
In this short article I&#8217;ll show you an example of how to collect email addresses
from the comments of a WordPress.com blog and the UserVoice feedback/ticketing system.</p>

<h2>WordPress.com</h2>

<p>For your WordPress.com blog from the Admin Dashboard navigate to
Settings -> Webhooks and add a new webhook with action <code>comment_post</code>
and fields <code>comment_author</code>, <code>comment_author_email</code>. A simple
Django view that handles the input is shown below.</p>

<p><code>store_user_details()</code> is a function which handles the email/name received in the webhook,
possibly adding them to a database or anything else.</p>

<p>I find webhooks extremely easy to setup and develop and used them whenever they are
supported by the service provider. What other services do you use webhooks for? Please
share your story in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m starting a new series where I will share my thoughts about software design,
usability and other related topics with examples of items I like or dislike.
I&#8217;ve
<a href="/blog/2013/05/30/why-vmware-multi-hypervisor-manager-architecture-is-wrong/">written before</a>
about the topic so consider this post as a sequel. I&#8217;m starting with couple of
examples from the mobile world. Plese use the comments to tell if there is something
that you particulary like or dislike in software or hardware design
(and apologies to my readers for not being able to post more frequently lately).</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Camera Burst Feature vs. Android</h2>

<p>BlackBerry 10 Camera&#8217;s burst mode is well made in my opinion. It is capable of
taking thousands of pictures and saving the to disk without interruption. Thus
I am capable of taking pictures of fast moving objects like flash lights.</p>

<p><img src="/images/flashlight.jpg" title="Flash light" alt="Flash light" /></p>

<p>On the other hand I have access to an
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=htc%20one&linkCode=ur2&tag=atodorovorg-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=CZ33VB6BARW7FWZS">HTC One smartphone</a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
with Android. The burst
mode feature there is particularly crappy. It shoots between 20 to 50 photos
(haven&#8217;t counted how much exactly), then takes a second to flash everything to disk,
then pops a question asking the user to select the best one and possibly delete
the rest. If you don&#8217;t want all of this just tap the back button to return to
shooting mode.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Hub</h2>

<p>Hub is another well designed application which integrates all of your accounts and
messaging into the core of the OS although other mobile OSes have a similar feature
as well if I&#8217;m not mistaken. I just mention it because it is easy and comfortable to use.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Memory Management</h2>

<p>BlackBerry 10 OS memory management is particularly crappy with respect to
the end user. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is due to QNX being real-time OS
or just the Java stack keeping stuff in memory.</p>

<p>After some usage my development Z10 will begin experiencing out of memory issues
(it has 1 GB of RAM vs. 2 GB in production hardware). This will lead to apps
crashing, web pages that were able to open, not being able to load and the most
annoying of all - camera starts taking pictures with random color spots.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bbz10camerafail.jpg" title="BlackBerry Z10 camera fail" alt="Blackberry camera fail" /></p>

<p>After restarting the device everything is back to normal :(.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Date and Time Synchronization</h2>

<p>This one I also hate a lot. It appears that the software is designed to
automatically synchronize over the Internet and without a reliable connection fails miserably.
After reboot (or even worse battery removal) the device will start with a fixed date and time
somewhere in the past. If it fails to synchronize or takes too long several things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Blackberry Hub application loads first (email and other accounts) which causes all sorts
of warnings of invalid SSL certificates. Which in their own right are annoying because Cancel
means dismiss the warning until the next connection retry; which blocks access to the main menu
for manual configuration;</li>
<li>All images taken by the Camera app will be saved on disk with the wrong date which makes you think
they are gone; I&#8217;ve found this by accident while scrolling way back in my history looking for something
unrelated.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Multiple File Selection</h2>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tested this explicitly on Android or other mobile devices but on BlackBerry
the user needs to tap each individual object to select it. My guess is this is similar
on all devices utilizing a touch screen.  However such interface makes it damn hard to
select a thousand files for deletion (the unusable results from the camera burst mode feature).
Luckily Z10 (and possibly others) has a shell application with <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> and <code>rm -f</code> commands.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve purchased a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0RQSD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B0RQSD0&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=ELZCDTH62GGNKJTL">wireless range extender</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00B0RQSD0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
as the one shown here. It had troubles connecting to the upstream Wi-Fi router
because it used MAC filtering instead of password security. Luckily there was
a <a href="http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=56386.0">forum thread</a> which helped
me figure it out.</p>

<h2>DAP 1320 uses two MAC addresses</h2>

<p>Everything was working just fine with MAC filtering disabled on the upstream
router but failed miserably when enabled. I thought the MAC address provided
on the DAP 1320 packaging was wrong.</p>

<p>It turned out the device had 2 addresses.
The one on the packaging is <em>70:62:B8:07:0B:76</em> and it didn&#8217;t matter if that
is enabled or disabled in the router settings. The second MAC is used when
trying to forward connections through the router. Both addresses differ by the
second symbol with a difference of 2. So I&#8217;ve enabled <em>72:62:B8:07:0B:76</em>
in the router settings and everything worked like a charm.</p>

<h2>Other findings</h2>

<p>Unfortunately if a device is connected to the wifi extender&#8217;s network it will
bypass the MAC filtering employed on the upstream wifi router. As much as I dislike
using passwords for Wi-Fi I had to configure one for the extended network.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also found that when you save the configuration file from the device on your
hard drive it comes in a base64-encoded-line-by-line format. Pretty awkward.</p>

<p>Another pleasant (but not entirely surprising) finding was that D-Link included
a written acknowledgment of using open source components and an offer to provide
source code upon request.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/evolve_digital.jpg" title="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" alt="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I&#8217;ve visited an event organized by the
<a href="http://www.atlantic-club.org/index.php?en">Atlantic Club of Bulgaria</a> which
officially marked the launch of a digital national alliance in Bulgaria. This is
part of an initiative of the European Commission, called
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs">Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs</a>,
which aims to address the lack of
sufficient amount and quality professionals in Europe working in the
field of Information and Communication technologies.</p>

<p>The first part was few short keynotes, including one from deputy prime minister
and memorandum signing and group photo. In the keynotes (and afterwards)
the stress was on the lack of relevant ICT skills and the need of an estimated
1 million digital workers by 2020 in EU alone.</p>

<p>The next two sessions were panel discussions. The first one presenting the local
chapter of the Digital Coalition in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The goals of the coalition are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>help more people master more digital skills (not only as developers but also
proper usage of social media, how to create content, etc)</li>
<li>enable more people to choose digital jobs</li>
<li>help local talents present themselves on the global scene</li>
</ul>


<p>How it (is supposed to) works:</p>

<ul>
<li>initiate own ideas and propose them for implementation (to the ICT industry and broad public I guess)</li>
<li>stimulate learning through doing, learning by example using real use cases</li>
<li>help (and possibly sponsor) outside projects and ideas</li>
</ul>


<p>Then the various companies supporting the coalition pledged how they are going to
help. The most interesting news from this panel was the announcement of a new HP
data center in Sofia which will be used as a training lab with access available to
students.</p>

<p>The second panel was about education and how to bridge the gap! The interesting points were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ministry of Education and Science admits they have finally realized that our educational
system and programs are behind current tendencies and need concrete steps in order to boost
education and science research;</li>
<li>Samsung will open their innovation lab at Sofia University to outside students as well;</li>
<li>We need to pay more attention to content and training of teachers because they also have
a skills gap while young children do not;</li>
</ul>


<p>I particularly liked what Prof. Petar Kenderov from the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics
at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences said - in the outside world children are constantly sharing
and communicating with each other while at school (also to some extent in universities) they
are expected to not communicate, not share and keep quiet. He emphasized the value of learning through
experimentation vs. learning through reading and writing, e.g. the current way things work
and the old way of teaching.</p>

<p>Another thing that was obvious was that otherwise competing companies (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
VMware) were working together to fix some of the problems mentioned. However I&#8217;m a bit skeptical
that large multi-national companies will be flexible enough to make a positive change.
I&#8217;d bet on the independent organizations like <a href="https://hackbulgaria.com/">HackBulgaria</a> and
Svetlin Nakov&#8217;s <a href="https://softuni.bg/">Software University</a> or initiatives by local Bulgarian companies

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week ended up with <a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a>.
The event was very big this year, with 4 halls and 600 visitors.
I was moderating the so called <em>JavaScript</em> hall and will concentrate on
what happened there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bgws2014.jpg" title="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" alt="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" />
This is what my hall looked like at around 10:00 and stayed pretty much the same
during the entire day.</p>

<p>Speakers at hall Rhodopi were (in order of appearance)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/delian">Delian Delchev</a> talking about the JavaScript
revolution taking over the world and how this language has become the most
widely used programming language in the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hkdobrev">Haralan Dobrev</a> with some tips about development
workflows, git, continuous integration and unit testing.</li>
<li>Yoga for Geeks during the lunch break.</li>
<li>Boyan Dzhumakov with topics about home automation and Internet of things, who
demonstrated his bed side lamp controlled via a light sensor and Arduino.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boyanov.org/">Neven Boyanov</a> continuing on the hardware topics with
comparison of ATmel, Arduino and Raspberry Pi and showing more examples of
small programmable devices.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/attodorov">Angel Todorov</a> from Infragistics with a very
interesting talk about JavaScript instrumentation for performance analysis.
A very cool presentation and you should definitely check out his
<a href="https://github.com/attodorov/cheetah.js">cheetah.js</a> framework.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/KrasimirTsonev">Krasimir Tsonev</a> with
<a href="http://absurdjs.com/">AbsurdJS</a> - a JavaScript library with superpowers.
Teaser: Krasimir is also publishing a book caled
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/472723298053537792">Node.js Blueprints</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/krokodilerian">Vasil Kolev</a> with a talk about security
and web service design and how most of the web is doing it wrong :).</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately there is no video or audio recording available. If you find
some of the talks interesting and would like to get more info about it let
me know. I will ask the presenters to share their slides or give more details
where possible.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;ve missed the Web Summit in Sofia. There will be another one
in the autumn, held at Veliko Tarnovo. For more info please subscribe to the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing to report on the last few events that took place in Sofia this week.</p>

<p>Day #2 of DigitalK started with the presentation of Piotr Jas of BlaBla Car.
What I really liked about it (picture TBA) was one particular graph depicting
the various types of travel (time before travel vs. cost of travel) and
visualizing different industries (e.g. air travel) or competitor companies.
The image clearly exhibited a blank space which is the exact market segment
where BlaBla Car have positioned themselves in.</p>

<p>A very practical and easy to use tool for entrepreneurs in my opinion.</p>

<p>From the rest of the keynotes I can outline two in particular:
Ivan Hernandez&#8217; <em>Disruptive Innovation and the future of Digital Transformation</em>
and <em>The future of Tech and Communities</em> by Tim Röhrich.</p>

<p>I liked them because both were very inspirational although not telling you
something which you haven&#8217;t heard before. They were basically reinforcing
the spirit of the event.</p>

<p>In the small hall there was a workshop called
<em>How to turn a good idea into a successful start-up</em> led by Daniela Neumann,
which didn&#8217;t turn out to be what I expected. She was talking about the early
cycle of idea/customer validation and I don&#8217;t remember any particular example
being shown. Frankly most of the people have heard about this before (myself included)
and were quite bored. Not many of them stayed till the end.</p>

<p>The evening continued with the already traditional Silicon Drinkabout in Sofia
which hosted many of the conference attendees. I did a quick visit only
because I had to prepare myself for Bulgaria Web Summit on the next day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The conference season (this week) is officially open! So here&#8217;s my report about it.</p>

<p>It started by accident last evening with a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/629009950539772/">warm-up event</a>
sponsored by Twilio at betahaus Sofia. I had the pleasure to have a long chat
with <a href="https://twitter.com/lilaineurope">Lisa from Twilio</a> over a few beers.</p>

<p>Today was Day #1 of <a href="http://digitalk.bg/">DigitalK</a> which is the leading SEE
technology event. I&#8217;ve also visited the event last year and must say that this
time it is bigger. The main hall was totally packed. The WiFi connectivity has been
improved since last year but still sucked. I had more success using my 3G instead.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of Day #1 was the mini Seedcamp session which presented
10 startups. In order of appearance they are</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.adtapsy.com/">AdTapsy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoini.com/">Bitcoini.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ikollect.net/">iKollect</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rocketads.co/">RocketAds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scalewhale.eu/">ScaleWhale</a></li>
<li><a href="https://angel.co/smartoken">Smartoken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stepsss.co/">Stepsss</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.talkie_kids.talkie">Talkie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://viblast.com/">Viblast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiziva.com">Wiziva</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Viblast, Stepsss and Talkie were the 3 finalists who also presented at the main hall.
Needless to say the coolest one from technology point of view is Viblast, which is
a peer-to-peer video streaming platform, utilizing WebRTC. They were also strong at the
presentation and look very strong at the business level as well. I wish them good luck.</p>

<p>Stepsss is essentially a shoe sole with sensors paired with smart-phone apps to
give runners more info and feedback. I like it because they are a hardware company
although there&#8217;s lots of competition in this space. I&#8217;d like to beta test their product
and see what happens when I go dancing all night long :).</p>

<p>Talkie is an educational app for children which helps them learn new languages. I had the
pleasure to see it in action before the actual presentation. The design is very cool
and the app does seem usable and complete. However I don&#8217;t see much of a technological
challenge here and I&#8217;m not sure how will they deal with the strong competition in the ed-tech
space. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>From the rest ScaleWhale and Smartoken do seem interesting but I really failed to get how things
will be organized on the technology side. Both ideas are run by a single person team, which
is a recipe for disaster (judging from my own experience).</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Day #2 of DigitalK and on Saturday I&#8217;m moderating one of the rooms at
<a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a>. Expect more reports soon.</p>
