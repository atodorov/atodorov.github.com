  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you generate useful stats from a git repo? In particular how do you
calculate the monetary cost of development effort behind that git repo?
I&#8217;ve found the <a href="https://github.com/hoxu/gitstats">gitstats</a> project which
helped me answer the above question.</p>

<p>Git clone the repo and make sure you
have Python and Gnuplot installed. <code>gitstat</code> will generate html files and
graphics from your git history.</p>

<p>In my case I only needed to know how long it took for a project to be developed.
It turned out that around 56% of the days since day one were active and there were
an average of 8,5 commits per active day in the repo.</p>

<p>I took the number of active days and multiplied by an average daily
wage to come up with a real number. This is what I consider to be the cost to
develop the software from scratch. This is overly simplified, but serves my
needs to establish some base line.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">COCOMO</a> method which is probably
more accurate but I didn&#8217;t find any usable online COCOMO calculator.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Linux there is a feature called USB networking which provides you with a
TCP/IP connection to another device connected via USB cable. Here is how to
connect your <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>
to your Linux laptop over USB. I use Red Hat Enterprise Linux but should work
out of the box for other distros too.</p>

<p>Connect the Z10 to your laptop:</p>

<pre><code>    $ lsusb
    Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0fca:8020 Research In Motion, Ltd. Blackberry Playbook (CD-Rom mode)
</code></pre>

<p>By default many USB devices will present a virtual CD-ROM with drivers for Windows.
This is the case here too. To change it go to <code>Settings - Storage and Access</code> and
set <code>USB Connection</code> to <code>Connect to Mac</code>!</p>

<p>If necessary plug out and back in the Z10.</p>

<pre><code>    $ lsusb
    Bus 001 Device 007: ID 0fca:8013 Research In Motion, Ltd.

    $ ifconfig
    usb0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1E:69:A5:D0:11:0A  
              inet addr:169.254.0.2  Bcast:169.254.0.3  Mask:255.255.255.252
              inet6 addr: fe80::1c69:a5ff:fed0:110a/64 Scope:Link
              UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
              RX packets:49 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
              TX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
              RX bytes:16002 (15.6 KiB)  TX bytes:1152 (1.1 KiB)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> In the same <code>Storage and Access</code> screen scroll down to
<code>USB Mass Storage</code> and turn it <code>Off</code>. If you don&#8217;t do this your Z10 will appear
as USB flash drive and no USB networking will be available. This is how it looks:</p>

<pre><code>    $ lsusb
    Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0fca:8014 Research In Motion, Ltd. 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you need your Z10 storage accessible together with USB networking
you can try accessing the device over Wi-Fi.
Configure it from the same <code>Storage and Access</code> screen. Then your device will be
available through Samba on its wireless IP address. I&#8217;ve tried it, works for me!</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need anything else to get this working. All set!</p>

<p>My intention is to use either USB networking or Wi-Fi to
<a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Testing-and-Deployment/How-to-use-blackberry-connect-to-Enable-SSH-Access/ta-p/1515447">connect to the Z10 shell</a>
and explore it in more details.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can honestly state that <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a> sucks big
time when it comes to importing your contacts from another non-BlackBerry
device. I&#8217;ve been struggling to transfer my contacts from
<a href="http://amzn.to/10USRm2">Nokia 6303</a> to the Z10 for one day.</p>

<p>I tried a simple sync of the contacts from Nokia to Z10 over Bluetooth but
that failed miserably, telling me the Z10 doesn&#8217;t support this functionality.
This is what to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Nokia - <code>Settings - Sync and backup - Create backup</code>;</li>
<li>Then navigate to <code>Apps - Extras - Memory card - Backup files</code>;</li>
<li>Select the most recent backup file, e.g. <code>Backup000.NBF</code> and
transfer it via Bluetooth (or USB cable) to my laptop;</li>
</ul>


<p>For the record: this is a ZIP file with different extension. I&#8217;ve tried also
to transfer it to the Z10 and open from File manager but to no avail.</p>

<ul>
<li>Just unzip the file on the computer;</li>
<li>When extracted it will create multiple directories with meaningless names.
Just find whatever you need - in my case this was the <code>contacts/</code> directory
containing hundreds of <code>.vcf</code> files;</li>
<li><p>Combine all the <code>.vcf</code> files into one. On Linux this is done with</p>

<pre><code>  cat *.vcf &gt; ../all.vcf
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>For the record: I&#8217;ve tried also sending all of these files to Z10. Via the
File manager individual vCards open just fine but you need to <code>Save</code> them one
by one. The combined vCard file didn&#8217;t display correctly at all. Showed only one
contact.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Then go to Gmail (or any other CardDAV service) and import all your vCards.
Go to <code>Contacts - More - Import</code> - and select the combined vCard file since Gmail
doesn&#8217;t support multi-file uploads;</p></li>
<li><p>On your BlackBerry go to <code>Settings - Accounts</code> and add your Gmail account.
By default this will create profiles for mail, calendar and contacts which will
be synchronized with the device.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>WARNING</strong> I had my Gmail previously configured on the Z10. Despite the account
was configured to re-sync every 15 minutes it took around 2 hours for phone numbers
to sync. And to make it worse there is no button for manual re-sync.</p>

<p>All of this done I have thousands of contacts on my Z10 spread across phone numbers,
emails, vCards and contacts from social networks. I&#8217;ve noticed some of them (my guess
those that had the same email or name) combined auto-magically. The rest can easily be
linked together using the Contacts app Link functionality.</p>

<p>For the record: It is also possible to send vCards one by one directly from Nokia to
Z10 via Bluetooth. The trouble is that for every entry you need to go through several
layers of menu options and confirmations. This makes it impractical.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Importing hundreds of contacts from Nokia to BlackBerry Z10 is MIA;</li>
<li>BB Contacts app (and BB Hub) is cool but has some bugs;</li>
<li>Needs manual contact re-sync button;</li>
<li>Gmail re-sync took longer than expected;</li>
<li><p>Contacts Link feature can be improved and made more easy to use, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>grid style display</li>
<li>multiple select and link</li>
<li>swipe and link, etc;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The current Link interface is sub-optimal</p>

<ul>
<li>select a contact</li>
<li>tap Links</li>
<li>tap Add Link</li>
<li>tap Search</li>
<li>type and find the entries you&#8217;d like to link;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The current Link interface is buggy - when searching contacts to add
as links it shows the currently opened contact too. Luckily it doesn&#8217;t
crash when the same entry is selected :). I&#8217;ve tried.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is with OS Version 10.0.10.261.</p>

devices for free and I will tell you how I did it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Find a hardware vendor that has<br/>launched new products, is behind competitors in terms of software eco-system<br/>and present them with a great application which you will code on their device.</p></blockquote>


<p><img src="/images/bbz10_tshirt.jpg" alt="BlackBerry Z10 T-Shirt" style="display:block;clear:both;" /></p>

<p>This week I&#8217;ve been at the BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam in Sofia and I got a
<a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a> Dev Alpha B smart-phone.</p>

<p>BlackBerry 10 OS is different from previous versions. It has a QNX kernel and is
largely incompatible with previous software. This means all apps need to be rewritten.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that BlackBerry is behind Android, iPhone and probably Windows Phone
in terms of applications. It is in their interest to lower the barrier to entry for developers
and boost their software eco-system. Which in turn makes customers happy because they can
find all sorts of applications. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

<p>Being a Linux guy
my idea is to trade my <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">Lenovo X220</a> for a smart-phone.
The only thing(s) I need is all the command line tools which I use: bash, vim, coreutils
and most notably Python. So I&#8217;ve decided to try and port all of these to the BlackBerry 10 OS.
It should be doable because QNX is POSIX compliant and the OS itself comes with C/C++ and
Qt/QML native development stack.</p>

<p>I have a few other ideas which are still taking shape in my head and are mostly towards
mobile development.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard <a href="http://www.bbdevbalkan.com">BlackBerry Developer Group Balkan</a> may
have some devices to give away to developers so I simply asked. They liked my ideas and
agreed to give me a developer device.</p>

<p>In addition
they&#8217;ve given away the real product (not dev alpha devices) for free at Twitter contests
held during couple of events so far. Several guys I know were lucky enough to win the prizes.</p>

<h2>The OLPC XO laptop</h2>

<p><img src="/images/olpc_xo.jpg" alt="OLPC XO laptop" style="float:left;margin-right:10px" /></p>

<p>In the past I&#8217;ve taken part in testing <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> onto
the XO laptop produced by the <a href="http://laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> project.</p>

<p>It is cool and innovative device with its software especially adapted to
child education. The general public wanted to have a standard Linux distro
running on the same hardware. Fedora being the original foundation on which the XO
Linux distro was built was a good choice (among others).</p>

<p>I have received for free the XO laptop shown here and mainly tested networking
related stuff. After the test initiative was completed (and also the upstream OLPC
project ceased to exist closely after that) I got to keep the device for myself.</p>

<h2>Which device to get ?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll keep my eyes open for a Firefox OS or Ubuntu Phone devices. As they come into stores
they will have to compete with already established vendors.</p>

<p>Let me and everyone else know if you got a device for free being a developer! Share your
story and tips into the comments below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OpenShift is
<a href="https://www.openshift.com/content/custom-environment-variables">still missing</a>
the client side tools to set environment variables without exposing the values
in source code but there is a way to do it. Here is how.</p>

<p>First ssh into your application and navigate to the <code>$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR</code>.
Create a file to define your environment.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

laptop plus all books
from my <a href="/give-away/">Give Away List</a>, which are not currently taken.
Because this is not much I have an offer for everyone else, who would like to help.</p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>


<h2>What is the offer</h2>

<p><strong>Give a book or your old laptop and get a new one with discount!</strong>.</p>

<p>My company
<a href="http://otb.bg">Open Technologies Bulgaria, Ltd.</a> is an authorized reseller of Vali Computers and
Fujitsu. Hardware reselling is not the main company activity but a backup in case a customer
wants to purchase entire solution from one vendor.</p>

<p>I will not charge the standard reseller&#8217;s discount (between 5% and 10%) if you drop-off your books
or old laptops with me and agree to donated them to children.
The offer is valid as long as the donation campaign is (I don&#8217;t know how long but looks like ongoing).</p>

<p>You can select anything from <a href="http://www.vali.bg">http://www.vali.bg</a> with the reseller&#8217;s discount off!
Delivery or pick-up is on you though.</p>

<p>If you want to participate use the comments below and I will get in touch with you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you happen to be on holiday in Bulgaria but would still like to meet
some hackers there are three events this month that I find interesting:
Plovdiv Conf, BlackBerry Mini Developer Jam and Varna Conf.</p>

<p><img src="/images/code.jpg" alt="source code" style="display:block;clear:both;"/>
Image: source code from a game development course held at Sofia University couple of years ago.
Own work.</p>

<h2>Plovdiv Conf</h2>

<p><a href="http://plovdivconf.com/">Plovdiv Conf</a> will be held at the Plovdiv Fair
on July 6th 2013. There isn&#8217;t an official program but the speaker profiles are
interesting. Among them are guys well known for their Ruby and Linux skills.</p>

<p>From the given list I recognize only half the names. One speaker that sounds
interesting to me claims experience with programming assembler for the mainframe.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://akurtakov.blogspot.com/">Alexander Kurtakov</a> from Red Hat/Eclipse
will be there as well so I&#8217;m planning to attend this event.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia</h2>

<p>Organized by BlackBerry Developer Group Balkan the
<a href="http://bb10jamsofia2013.eventbrite.com/">BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia</a> will be held
on July 11th 2013 at <a href="http://betahaus.bg">betahaus Sofia</a>. Last time I visited
a <a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">BlackBerry developers session</a> it
was very interesting.</p>

<p>My personal interest at the moment is not developing mobile applications but I&#8217;d like to hear
more about the possibilities. My understanding is that BlackBerry 10 is much more flexible
as a development platform compared to Android and iOS.</p>

<p>I will definitely attend this event because there will be a shiny new <strong>BlackBerry Z 10</strong>
waiting for me there :). I will tell you how to secure one after I get it.</p>

<h2>Varna Conf</h2>

<p><a href="http://varnaconf.com/">Varna Conf</a> is organized by the same people who do Plovdiv Conf.
It will be held on July 20th 2013 at Cherno More hotel in Varna.</p>

<p>Most of the speakers I don&#8217;t know but there are couple of topics about testing and refactoring
which look interesting. However I will be more likely to socialize with the local development
groups rather than listening to all talks.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I will attend though. My initial plan was to attend but there are other personal
errands that are popping up. Given that it is not near Sofia I will probably skip it.</p>

<p>If you happen
to be on holiday at the Bulgarian sea side however, you should definitely check it out. And Varna is
a very nice city too.</p>

<p>Let me know if there are other interesting events in the vicinity! Use the comments and tell me where
are you going this month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Which Django cache backend is faster? Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon S3 ?</p>

<p>Previously I&#8217;ve mentioned about
<a href="/blog/2013/06/19/django-tips-using-cache-for-stateful-http/">using Django&#8217;s cache to keep state between HTTP requests</a>.
In my demo described there I was using <a href="http://github.com/atodorov/django-s3-cache">django-s3-cache</a>.
It is time to move to production so I decided to measure the performance difference between the two
cache options available at Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2013-07-01</strong>: my initial test may have been false since I had not configured
ElastiCache access properly. I saw no errors but discovered the issue today on another
system which was failing to store the cache keys but didn&#8217;t show any errors either.
I&#8217;ve re-run the tests and updated times are shown below.</p>

<h2>Test infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
<li>One Amazon S3 bucket, located in US Standard (aka US East) region;</li>
<li>One Amazon ElastiCache cluster with one Small Cache Node (cache.m1.small) with Moderate I/O capacity;</li>
<li>One Amazon Elasticache cluster with one Large Cache Node (cache.m1.large) with High I/O Capacity;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve tested both <code>python-memcached</code> and <code>pylibmc</code> client libraries for Django;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Test is executed from an EC2 node in the us-east-1a availability zone;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Cache clusters are in the us-east-1a availability zone.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Test Scenario</h2>

<p>The test platform is Django. I&#8217;ve created a
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/Amazon-ElastiCache-vs-Amazon-S3-Django">skeleton project</a>
with only <code>CACHES</code> settings
defined and necessary dependencies installed. A file called <code>test.py</code> holds the
test cases, which use the standard timeit module. The object which is stored in cache
is very small - it holds a phone/address identifiers and couple of user made selections.
The code looks like this:</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>As expected ElastiCache is much faster (10x) compared to S3. However the difference
between the two ElastiCache node types is subtle. I will stay with the smallest
possible node to minimize costs. Also as seen, pylibmc is a bit faster compared to
the pure Python implementation.</p>

<p>Depending on your objects size or how many set/get operations you perform per
second you may need to go with the larger nodes. Just test it!</p>

<p><del>It surprised me how slow django-s3-cache is.</del>
The false test showed django-s3-cache to be 100x slower but new results are better.
10x decrease in performance sounds about right for a filesystem backed cache.</p>

<p>A quick look at the code
of the two backends shows some differences. The one I immediately see is that
for every cache key django-s3-cache creates an sha1 hash which is used as the
storage file name. This was modeled after the filesystem backend but I think the
design is wrong - the memcached backends don&#8217;t do this.</p>

<p>Another one is that django-s3-cache time-stamps all objects and uses pickle to serialize them.
I wonder if it can&#8217;t just write them as binary blobs directly. There&#8217;s definitely lots
of room for improvement of django-s3-cache. I will let you know my findings once I
get to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Where do I store my audio files in order to minimize download and call wait time?</p></blockquote>


<p>Twilio is a cloud vendor that provides telephony services.
It can download and <code>&lt;Play&gt;</code> arbitrary audio files and will cache the files
for better performance.</p>

<p>Twilio support told me they are not disclosing the location of their servers,
so from my web application hosted in AWS US East:</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<p>The <code>ip-*.ec2.internal</code> are clearly in US East. The <code>domU-*.computer-1.internal</code> also
look like US East although I&#8217;m not 100% sure what is the difference between the two.
The later ones look like HVM guests while the former ones are para-virtualized.</p>

<p>For comparison here are some internal addresses from my own EC2 systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>ip-10-228-237-207.eu-west-1.compute.internal - EU Ireland</li>
<li>ip-10-248-19-46.us-west-2.compute.internal - US West Oregon</li>
<li>ip-10-160-58-141.us-west-1.compute.internal - US West N. California</li>
</ul>


<p>After relocating my audio files to an S3 bucket in US East the average call length
dropped from 2:30 min to 2:00 min for the same IVR choices. This also minimizes
the costs since Twilio charges per minute of incoming/outgoing calls.
I think the audio quality has improved as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/facebook_ui_bug.png" alt="Faceook bug" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a small but very visible UI bug in Facebook. While selecting for which
applications to receive or not notifications there is a small progress bar image
that appears left of the checkbox element. The trouble is this image displaces the
checkbox and it appears to float right and left during the AJAX call. This is annoying.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an easy fix - either fix the progress image and checkbox positions so they don&#8217;t move
or place the image to the right.</p>

<p>In my practice these types of bugs are common. I usually classify them with High priority,
because they tend to annoy the user and generate support calls or just look unprofessional.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago a guy called Matt
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/celery-users/RFAuGjZwtmg">asked</a>
about passing large objects through their messaging queue. They were switching from
RabbitMQ to Amazon SQS which has a limit of 64K total message size.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve made some changes in <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> which require passing
larger objects as parameters to a Celery task. Since Difio is also using SQS I faced the
same problem. Here is the solution using a cache back-end:</p>

<p>Objects are persisted in a secondary cache back-end, not the default one, to avoid
accidental destruction. <code>uuid</code> parameter is a string.</p>

<p>Although the objects passed are smaller than 64K I haven&#8217;t seen any issues
with this solution so far. Let me know if you are using something similar in your code
and how it works for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you keep state when working with a stateless protocol like HTTP?
One possible answer is to use a cache back-end.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on an IVR application demo with Django and Twilio. The caller
will make multiple choices using the phone keyboard. All of this needs to be
put together and sent back to another server for processing. In my views
I&#8217;ve added a simple cache get/set lines to preserve the selection.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how it looks with actual application logic omitted</p>

<p>At each step Django will update the current state associated with this call and return
a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml">TwiML</a> XML response. <code>CallSid</code> is a handy unique
identifier provided by Twilio.</p>

<p>I am using the latest <a href="http://github.com/atodorov/django-s3-cache">django-s3-cache</a> version
which properly works with directories. When going to production that will likely switch to
Amazon ElastiCache.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently found Nibbler which gives you a report scoring the website out of
10 for various important criteria including accessibility, SEO, social media
and technology.</p>

<p>The produced report is very interesting. Here is the
<a href="http://nibbler.silktide.com/reports/atodorov.org">report for this blog</a>.
There are things I definitely need to work on!</p>

<p>For comparison <a href="http://nibbler.silktide.com/reports/sofiavalley.com">SofiaValley</a>
scores far beyond this blog. It is stronger in marketing and popularity but
apparently weaker on the technology section. This is interesting!</p>

<p>PS: sorry for not producing technical content lately. I&#8217;ve been very busy
with some current projects however I&#8217;ve got lots of ideas and topics to blog about.
I hope to make it up to speed in the next few weeks. &#8211; Alex</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier I wrote about my

Now this issue is back again! Bad luck!</p>

<p>Since my last card was re-issued I&#8217;ve used it <strong>only</strong> at Amazon Web Services, Google Apps and Globul. Nowhere else.
According to the bank representative, who woke me up this morning,
VISA has sent them a list of card numbers which need to be blocked immediately. The bank was vague about
it but briefly mentioned some kind of a leak of VISA&#8217;s card database.</p>

<p>Knowing how negligent payment operators can be I can easily accept this version. I&#8217;m wondering if there
will be an official press release from VISA. Let me know if you hear about this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found <a href="http://officesnapshots.com/">Office Snapshots</a> and they don&#8217;t have
any submissions from Bulgarian companies. No coincidence given the fact that many Bulgarian
offices are years behind contemporary work space design and architecture.</p>

<p>So I got an idea -
start my own blog section on this topic. It would be interesting to see the spaces
Bulgarian IT operates in. If the place is good - embrace it, if it sucks - despise it!
What do you think?</p>

<p>Selection rules are as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Needs to be local Bulgarian company or a local branch of a foreign company;</li>
<li>Can also be a start-up, an NGO or other organization;</li>
<li>Business is in the field of IT and technology; Co-working spaces are exception;</li>
</ul>


<p>Let me know which companies you want to see featured here! Can you arrange a visit for me - let me know!</p>

<p>People tend to think I have a dream job, when I tell them I don&#8217;t go to the office.
I will tell you a story about working from home, being a remotee and not having a
regular job. Welcome to the world of contracting and freelancing!</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>Definitions taken from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>An <strong>employee</strong> contributes labor and expertise to an endeavor of an employer and is usually hired
to perform specific duties which are packaged into a job. In most modern economies, the term
&#8220;employee&#8221; refers to a specific defined relationship between an individual and a corporation,
which differs from those of customer or client.</p>

<p>An <strong>independent contractor</strong> is a natural person, business, or corporation that provides goods
or services to another entity under terms specified in a contract or within a verbal agreement.</p>

<p>A <strong>freelancer</strong> is somebody who is self-employed and is not committed to a particular employer long term.
For the purpose of this article this is more or less the same as independent contractor but for
a short-term project.</p>

<p>Most important of all is that a contractor or freelancer is a separate entity from the organization they work for.</p>

<h2>How I became a contractor</h2>

<p>5+ years ago I was an employee for Red Hat in Czech Republic, but didn&#8217;t want to
permanently live there for many reasons. During my time abroad I was a frequent
traveler. I became comfortable working on the go and quite often my bosses didn&#8217;t
know where I was and that didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>After 1.5 years I left the company with an option to continue working for
Red Hat Switzerland as a contractor. This is how I started working from home.</p>

<h2>The dark side</h2>

<p>Many people think working from home is easy. Many think being a contractor
is better than being an employee. Many think being away from the office means
you will work less. Many think you will make more money. <strong>Most people are wrong!</strong></p>

<p>I will highlight the bad side of
being a contractor before exposing you to the goodies. Read the next parts before
even thinking to quit your job.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>Contracting or freelancing is much more different than having a regular job.
If you are lucky you will have a long-term project and have a somewhat regular
income. On the other hand freelancing is usually the term used when working on
smaller short-term projects. They are irregular, so is your income.</p>

<p>You need to plan in advance your expenses and make sure your income will cover them.
This is a lot easier with long-term projects.</p>

<p>Also have in mind that contracts and projects can be delayed, terminated and postponed
relatively easy on behalf of the customer and there isn&#8217;t much you can do. At best they have
already paid you for the job done until now and you are out looking for the next customer.</p>

<p>Longer-term contracts I&#8217;ve been working on had the option to terminate without any explanation
given in two to four weeks. This is a risk you have to accept and have a contingency plan
if your income depends on a single long-term project.</p>

<p>You either get paid by the hour or a lump sum on predefined milestone (e.g. half before, half after delivery).
Either way you trade time for money which isn&#8217;t optimal (same thing do employees btw).
The best thing you can do is become an expert in your field and begin consulting.
This is trading less time plus expertise for money - much better.</p>

<h2>Employee benefits</h2>

<p>Employees do get a lot of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Christmas bonus</li>
<li>Quarterly bonus if the company is doing well</li>
<li>Performance oriented bonuses</li>
<li>25 days of paid vacation which increase the longer you work</li>
<li>Extra health care</li>
<li>Unemployment insurance, social securities, etc.</li>
<li>Gym or other sport activities in the office</li>
<li>Lunch or some snacks at the office</li>
<li>Free car/cell phone/laptop, whatever</li>
</ul>


<p>The bigger and more people oriented the company the more the benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Contractors get nothing!</strong> Your contract payment is the only thing you get.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want a vacation - you don&#8217;t get paid!</li>
<li>If you are sick - you don&#8217;t get paid!</li>
<li>If you need equipment - you have to buy it!</li>
</ul>


<p>Get used to it and plan accordingly.</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>

<p>In every country dealing with tax authorities is a hell. If you are a sole proprietor in
Bulgaria chances are you will pay more taxes and social securities compared to being a
company for the same revenue. If you can, always incorporate a company and contract through it.</p>

<p>Find a good accountant (as much as you can afford though) and make sure they know everything
about your income and activities. It&#8217;s always better to hire an accounting company which
can grant you some protection and liability against prosecution from tax authorities - for example
if they get their calculation wrong. The extent of this should be written in a contract.</p>

<p>If necessary also hire a lawyer. If you deal with lots of paperwork and contracts (or NDAs)
this is definitely a wise thing to do. Don&#8217;t spare your money, spare yourself going to jail.</p>

<h2>Work environment</h2>

<p>Working from your bedroom sounds cool but it isn&#8217;t. You need a quiet and comfortable
place to work. Every-day house distractions are your worst enemy. You need much greater
discipline compared to working in an office.</p>

<p>My own work environment has evolved to having the best
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=computer%20chairs&linkCode=ur2&sprefix=computer%20chairs%2Caps%2C318&tag=atodorovorg-20&url=search-alias%3Doffice-products">office chair</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
from Sweden, custom designed furniture to make my life easier
and access stuff more quickly, maximum usage of storage space at home,
SOHO network designed by myself so that every device has its place and plug,
backup Internet connections, etc. <strong>You need to invest in your work space to reap the benefits later</strong>.</p>

<p>I also follow a strict regime and have some fixed hours for work and no-work related activities.
I split them between regular 9-5 business hours and evening/early morning to have more
flexibility. Whatever the case you have to plan your activities and stick to your plan.</p>

<p>In the office there&#8217;s always time for a coffee or some chit-chat.
At home there is not. Every hour counts to your bonus so it is in your interest to log
as many hours as possible and perform actual work during them. There are some freelance websites
such as oDesk (which sucks btw) that require you to install software to monitor your screen,
camera and keyboard in order the customer to see you were actually working.</p>

<p>Beware that there are physical limits which you can&#8217;t break without putting your health
at risk. I&#8217;ve tried working 200+ hours a month. It is doable once or twice a year when you
have lot of things to do. But you can&#8217;t do it all the time. I&#8217;ve tried, trust me.</p>

<p>Another important thing is the social element. Being out of the office minimizes the opportunities
to socialize with co-workers or simply ask for help. A contractor needs some other way to
compensate for this - being part of special interest groups, attending events and the like.</p>

<h2>No customers risk</h2>

<p>As with every business there is a risk of not having the right customers or not having them
at all. There are several things you can do to minimize this risk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be an expert in at least one field - this is your primary focus; For example:
I&#8217;m an expert in Quality Engineering and Red Hat Enterprise Linux;</li>
<li>Become very good professional in few more fields - mine are cloud computing,
Python and Django and general open source programming;</li>
<li>Grow your network of friends, co-workers, IT professionals and possible customers -
you never know where the next customer will come from;</li>
<li>Stay current with popular technologies (no need to be expert) so you can learn quickly if
the need arises;</li>
<li>Have some backup skills where there isn&#8217;t much competition and customers will have a hard time
finding the right guy. Also make sure you know where to find these customers. My skill is
Pascal - its an old language but there are lots of legacy software which still needs to be
maintained. Did you know you can even run COBOL in the cloud these days?</li>
</ul>


<p>Diversify and be flexible - you have the opportunity to generate income from
various sources - use it. I will tell you about mine in the next part of this article.</p>

<p><a href="http://sofiavalley.com">SofiaValley</a> recently had a bug in their UI.
As seen above when clicking the Like button the widget would overlap with
other visual elements. At first this doesn&#8217;t look like a big deal but it blocks
the user from sharing the page via Facebook which is important for a blog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bugs/sv-bug-fixed.png" alt="SV bug fixed" style="clear:both;display:block;"/></p>

<p>I have reported the error and it was fixed very quickly. +1 for SofiaValley.</p>

<p>Have you spotted any other interesting bugs? Let me know and they will be published
here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week (28.05.2013) I&#8217;ve attended an interesting
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/244624942345762/248165165325073/">event</a>, called
“Call of the Guru”, that was held at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at
Sofia University. The idea was to get a group of IT professionals (gurus) to talk to
young students on topics related to work, academia, start-up and open source.</p>

Check their event reviews as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2013/05/27/it-jobs-prediction-quality-engineering-devops-augmented-reality/">another post</a>
I&#8217;ve already shared my thoughts on future IT jobs. Here I will talk about what open source
means for students.</p>

<h2>Why hack open source</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s the number one question students will ask. The answer is simple</p>

<blockquote><p>It gives you experience and you become a hacker!</p></blockquote>


<p>There is absolutely no way one could graduate in their early 20s, not work
during study and have 3-5 years of experience as required by many job offers.
Unless one hacks open source.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source is real world, not a play project. There are many interesting problems
to be solved; There&#8217;s always work to be done;</li>
<li>Complex software teaches you software design/architecture patterns;</li>
<li>Larger projects like Linux distributions can also teach you about software release
cycle and release processes;</li>
<li>You work with a team, which drives you forward and you gain experience;</li>
<li>You learn to be patient as your work is reviewed by others and mistakes pointed out;</li>
<li>Larger projects use several different languages so you learn them; or alternatively
hack on different projects;</li>
<li>You communicate - via email and IRC mostly but that teaches you communication
skills. To see the difference between how educated people talk and how politicians
talk listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJldn_MmMY">this video</a>;</li>
<li>You make friends and connections which may benefit you later in your career;</li>
<li>Many open source companies recruit right from the community. I know lots of
people who landed their dream job by hacking for fun.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a student, if you can afford not getting a job it&#8217;s better to use your time on
open source projects. This is what I did as a young student and a junior developer.
The rest is history!</p>

<h2>What to do</h2>

<p>There are many things one can do in open source - write code, test software and
find bugs, write automated test cases, translate to local languages,
design user interfaces and project websites,
maintain wiki articles, provide help to users on forums or IRC channels, help organize
events, etc. All of this is respected in the community and gives credibility.</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already read <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker</a> by
Eric Raymond you should do so right away. Then come back and finish this article.</p>

<p>For those who&#8217;d like to start coding but have no idea where to start take a look at
<a href="http://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>OpenHatch is a non-profit dedicated to matching prospective free software contributors with communities, tools, and education.</p></blockquote>


<p>If you still like to be a developer but don&#8217;t feel confident enough to hack on the core of
the project I&#8217;d recommend you start by writing automated test cases. Writing test cases doesn&#8217;t
require much previous experience in programming and lets you explore and learn the internals
of the software you&#8217;re testing. With that knowledge you will become more confident and start
writing on the core features if you like. I am myself a QA but regularly contribute patches to
software I test because I know how it works or why it doesn&#8217;t and it&#8217;s easy for me to fix it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d better start as a translator check <a href="https://www.transifex.com">Transifex</a>.
It&#8217;s used by both commercial and open source entities and has become the de-facto standard in
open source translation tools. Btw the entire Transifex company was build after trying to
solve a particular problem in the Fedora Project and they are an open source company.</p>

<p>For general news about open source check <a href="http://opensource.com/">OpenSource.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Have questions? I have answers</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask me anything about open source and/or how to get involved with it.
I will gladly share my experience (learned the hard-way in the old days) or point you
to other folks who may know more on the topic.</p>

<time datetime="2013-05-30T23:36:00+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 30<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
         | <a href="/blog/2013/05/30/why-vmware-multi-hypervisor-manager-architecture-is-wrong/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&#8217;ve visited the annual
<a href="http://www.openhouse.vmware-bulgaria.com/">VMware Open House Event</a> in Sofia.
One of the sessions discussed their product
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/mhm/doc/vcenter-multi-hypervisor-manager-10-release-notes.html">vCenter Multi-Hypervisor Manager</a>
and the developers explained their architecture and technology behind it.
I think they are wrong.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vmware_mhm_architecture.png" alt="MHM Architecture" style="clear:both;display:block;"/>
Image taken from product release notes.</p>

<p>As shown above the purple-orange components are the MHM ones. They are designed as
plug-ins to the vCenter product and can not function as stand alone products.
vCenter MHM Server is responsible for communicating with 3rd party hypervisors
and then talks back to the MHM Extension in vCenter which feeds the MHM Plug-In (the UI).
I see three bad design decisions here:</p>

<p>1) The plugin architecture makes both the management layer and the UI a separate module.
As was shown in a demo session the user can not manage/visualize ESX and Hyper-V hosts/VMs
at the same time. They are managed and visualized in separate views.
This leads to non uniform user experience. Not to mention both UIs are different because the
supported hypervisor capabilities are different. -1 for user experience.</p>

<p>2) From what I understand both vCenter and MHM Extension provide API access. MHM one is not public yet.
Customers are using this API to build their own scripts around the infrastructure. For a customer
this means duplicating effort and maintaining scripts that talk to two separate APIs, although they
will be very similar to one another. -1 for making it easy on the customer.</p>

<p>3) From development point of view the top two components are not necessary. They introduce
extra development and management costs to the product. -1 for product maintainability.</p>

<h2>The Alternative</h2>

<p>One could design the same product in the fashion that <a href="http://libvirt.org">libvirt</a> does -
abstract all hypervisor details and provide a common API to build applications against.
In this case vCenter Server will be the application on top.
This interface will also report hypervisor capabilities so that the UI will be disabled
where appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/libvirt-driver-arch.png" alt="Libvirt Driver Architecture" style="clear:both;display:block;"/>
Image taken from <a href="http://libvirt.org/api.html">http://libvirt.org/api.html</a></p>

<p>I think libvirt&#8217;s approach is much cleaner and easier to maintain in the long term.</p>

<p>Indeed I&#8217;ve asked the question why not use libvirt -
it already supports ESX and Hyper-V as well as bunch of other hypervisors. I didn&#8217;t get a clear
answer on that, just that the team was looking at it, evaluated libvirt but opted to go
another way.</p>

<p>I still feel VMware has not learned how to do the open source dance as well as others do.
What do you think?</p>
