                    Shutdown Your Startup in 7 Steps
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>A month ago one of my startups Difio stopped working forever.
This is the story of how to go about shutting down a working
web service and not about why it came around to this.</p>
<h2>Step #1: Disable new registrations</h2>
<p>You obviously need to make sure new customers
arriving at your web site will not sing up to only find the service is
shutting down later.</p>
<p>Disable whatever sign-on/registration system you have in place
but leave currently registered users to login as they wish.</p>
<h2>Step #2: Disable payments</h2>
<p>Difio had paying customers, just not enough of them and it was based on
a subscription model which was automatically renewed without any interaction
from the customer.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to disable all payments for the service which
was quite easy (just a few comments) because Difio used an external payment
processor.</p>
<p>Next thing was to go through all subscriptions that were still active and
cancel them. This prevented the payment processor to automatically charge
the customers next time their subscription renewal was due.</p>
<p>Because all subscriptions were charged in advance and when canceled were
still considered active (due to expire at some later date) Difio had to
keep operating at least one month after all subscriptions have been canceled.</p>
<h2>Step #3: Notify all customers that you are shutting down</h2>
<p>I scheduled this to happen right after the last subscription was canceled.
An email to everyone who registered to the website and a blog post should work
for most startups. See ours <a href="http://www.dif.io/blog/2014/08/10/difio-is-shutting-down/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to provide a gratis period if necessary. Difio had a gratis period
of one month after the shutdown announcement.</p>
<h2>Step #4: Disable all external triggers</h2>
<p>Difio was a complex piece of software which relied on external triggers like
web hooks and repetitive tasks executed by cron.</p>
<p>Disabling these will prevent external services or hosting providers 
getting errors about your URLs not being accessible. It is just polite
to do so. </p>
<p>You may want to keep these still operational during the gratis period
before the physical shutdown or disable them straight away. In Difio's
case they were left operational because there were customers who have paid
in advance and relied on this functionality.</p>
<h2>Step #5: Prepare your 'Service Disabled' banner</h2>
<p>You will probably want to let people know why something isn't working
as it used (or is expected) to be. A simple page explaining that
you're going to shut down should be enough. </p>
<p>Difio required the user to be logged in to see most of the website.
This made it very easy to redirect everything to the same page.
A few more places were linking to public URLs which were manually rewritten
to point to the same 'Service Disabled' page.</p>
<p>It is the same page used previously to redirect new registrations to.</p>
<h2>Step #6: Terminate all processing resources</h2>
<p>Difio used both AWS EC2 instances and an OpenShift PaaS instance to do its
processing. Simply terminating all of them was enough. The only thing left
is a couple of static HTML pages behind the domain.</p>
<h2>Step #7: Database archival</h2>
<p>The last thing you need to do is archive your database. Although the
startup is out of business already you have gathered additional information
which may come handy at a later time.</p>
<p>Difio didn't collect any personal information about its users, except email
and didn't store financial information either. This made it safe to just make
a backup of the database and leave it lurking around on disk. </p>
<p>However beware 
if you have collected personal and/or financial information from your customers.
You may want to erase/anonymize some of it before doing your backups and
probably safeguard them from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>That's it, your startup is officially dead now! Let me know if I've missed 
something in the comments below.</p>

introduces startup founders and employees to the "Bullseye Framework," 
a five-step process successful companies use to get traction. 
This framework helps founders find the marketing channel that will be key to unlocking the next stage of growth. </p>
<p>Too often, startups building a product struggle with traction once they launch. 
This struggle has startups trying random tactics - some ads, a blog post or two - in an unstructured way that leads to failure. 
Traction shows readers how to systematically approach marketing, and covers how successful businesses have grown through each of
the following 19 channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viral Marketing</li>
<li>Public Relations (PR)</li>
<li>Unconventional PR</li>
<li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li>
<li>Social and Display Ads</li>
<li>Offline Ads</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Content Marketing</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Engineering as Marketing</li>
<li>Target Market Blogs</li>
<li>Business Development (BD)</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Affiliate Programs</li>
<li>Existing Platforms</li>
<li>Trade Shows</li>
<li>Offline Events</li>
<li>Speaking Engagements</li>
<li>Community Building </li>
</ul>
<p>The book is very easy to read and full of practical advice which should serve as a starting point and give you
more ideas how to approach a particular distribution channel. It took me two days to read and 
I already had some ideas to test even before reading the whole of it. My next steps are to apply the principles
to my current startup <a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">Obuvki 41 Plus</a> and a future one I have in mind.</p>
<p>To anyone building a startup of any kind I would recommend the following selection of books:</p>

                    Tip: Collecting Emails - Webhooks for UserVoice and WordPress.com
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In my practice I like to use webhooks and integrate auxiliary services with
my internal processes or businesses. One of these is the collection of emails.
In this short article I'll show you an example of how to collect email addresses
from the comments of a WordPress.com blog and the UserVoice feedback/ticketing system.</p>
<h2>WordPress.com</h2>
<p>For your WordPress.com blog from the Admin Dashboard navigate to 
Settings -&gt; Webhooks and add a new webhook with action <code>comment_post</code>
and fields <code>comment_author</code>, <code>comment_author_email</code>. A simple
Django view that handles the input is shown below.</p>

<p><code>store_user_details()</code> is a function which handles the email/name received in the webhook,

<p>I find webhooks extremely easy to setup and develop and used them whenever they are
supported by the service provider. What other services do you use webhooks for? Please

                    Book Review: UX for Lean Startups
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I've finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a>
and strongly recommend this book to anyone who is <strong>OR</strong> wants to be an
entrepreneur. Here is a short review of the book.</p>
<p>This book is for anyone who is creating a product/service or is considering the
idea of doing so. It talks about validation, interaction design and subsequent
product measurement and iteration. The book demonstrates some techniques and tools
to validate, design and measure your business ideas and products.
Its goal is to teach you how to design products that deliver fantastic user
experience, e.g. ones that are intuitive and easy to use.
It has nothing to do with visual design. </p>
<p>The author Laura Klein summarizes the book as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User research</p>
<p>Listen to your users. All the time. I mean it.</p>
<p>Validation</p>
<p>When you make assumptions or create hypotheses,
  test them before spending lots of time building products around them.</p>
<p>Design</p>
<p>Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Early Validation</h2>
<p>This chapter helped me a lot to understand what exactly is validation and how
to go about it. The flow is validating the problem you are trying to solve,
then the market and then the product. </p>
<p>I will also add that by using some of these research techniques around a
vague idea/area of interest you may come around a particular trend/pattern or problem 
and develop your business from there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve validated a problem when you start to hear
particular groups of people complaining about something specific.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Your goal in validating your market is to begin to narrow down the
group of people who will want their problems solved badly enough to buy
your product. Your secondary goal is to understand exactly why they’re
interested so you can find other markets that might be similarly motivated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve successfully validated your market when you can
accurately predict that a particular type of person will have a specific
problem and that the problem will be severe enough that that person is
interested in purchasing a solution.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Just because you have discovered a real problem and have a group of people
willing to pay you to solve their problem, that doesn’t necessarily mean that
your product is the right solution. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve validated your product when a large percentage of
your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>Next few chapters talk about user research, the various kinds of it and when/how
to perform it. It talks how to properly run surveys, how to ask good questions,
etc. </p>
<h2>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative research is about measuring what real people are actually
doing with your product. It doesn’t involve speaking with specific humans.
It’s about the data in aggregate. It should always be statistically significant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Quantitative research tells you <strong>what</strong> your problem is. Qualitative
research tells you <strong>why</strong> you have that problem.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you want to measure something that exists, like traffic or revenue or how
many people click on a particular button, then you want quantitative data.
If you want to know why you lose people out of your purchase funnel or
why people all leave once they hit a specific page, or why people seem not
to click that button, then you need qualitative.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Part Two: Design</h2>
<p>The second part of this book talks about design - everything from building a
prototype to figuring out when you don’t want one. It assumes you have validated
the initial idea and now move on to designing the product and validating that
design before you start building it. It talks about diagrams, sketches, wireframes,
prototypes and of course MVPs.</p>
<p>I think you can safely skip some of these steps when it comes to small applications
because it may be easier/faster to build the application instead of a prototype.
Definitely not to be skipped if you're building a more complex product!</p>
<h2>Part Three: Product</h2>
<p>This section talks about metrics and measuring the product once it is out of the door.
Supposedly based on these metrics you will refine your design and update the product
accordingly.  Most of the time it focuses on A/B testing and which metrics are
important and which are so called "vanity metrics".</p>
<p>I particularly liked the examples of A/B testing and explanations what it is good for
and what it does poorly. Definitely a mistake I've happened to made myself. I'm sure you too.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have read this book and what your thoughts are. Thanks!</p>

                    Why Taking Orders By Phone Works for My Start-up
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Yesterday I've
<a href="/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding/">mentioned</a>
a start-up project called
<a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">obuvki41plus.com</a> and that it accepts phone orders
instead of online electronic orders like everyone else. I will tell you why.</p>
<p><img src="/images/phone_order.jpg" alt="Taking phone orders" style="clear:both;display:block;" />
<em>Image CC-BY <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/southernfoodwaysalliance/3291060837/">Southern Foodways Alliance</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://obuvki41plus.com/">obuvki41plus.com</a> is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus, which are hard to find in Bulgaria.
There is a shopping cart component on the website which at the end redirects to
a simple page with instructions how to order via phone. Why not online
orders like everyone else? Several reasons!</p>
<p>The business target group is very limited - women who wear large shoe size
and like the proposed shoe style and can afford the higher price (quality shoes
only, sorry). On top of
that the business model is <strong>online only</strong>. The rule of thumb is to <strong>make
everything possible to lower barrier to entry for customers</strong>!
Also don't make our lives harder in doing so.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phone ordering is the easiest way for customers in Bulgaria.
I myself often prefer it because of the too many steps and too many fields
to fill-in when ordering online. The reality is that most local websites
are horribly made with respect to user experience and many users are not
that fluent with Internet as it may seem. No need to get people frustrated
if they are about to spend their money with you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone ordering, especially in the early business stage lets you know
your customers. This is invaluable feedback for you as the owner and you
can't get that from an online ordering system. It just doesn't work,
I've tried!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A phone ordering system is just so easy to implement. Later that can
be scaled with some automated IVR system and a call center; Or just
migrate it to online ordering system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The website in question is supposed to be no-maintenance as much
as possible. It is static HTML and no database at all. Introducing
online ordering is just too much of a technological overhead in this case;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but probably most important is customer care - not only we want to
make it easy for them to order but want to prevent frequent returns
caused by wrong product expectations or incorrect size. After all shoes
need to be tried first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So to summarize - the orders are taken in person via phone
including objection handling and questions answering. An order may consist
of up to 3 pairs of shoes which are shipped to the customer with the option
to try them out upon delivery! Buy all or just a pair - it's a customer call!
Small return fee is imposed to prevent abuse!</p>
<p>For that kind of business this seems to be the best solution so far.
I'd love to hear other owners experience and decision logic. Please use
the comments to tell us how you've organized the sales/ordering/delivery
process in your company and why so. Thanks!</p>

                <p><img src="/images/startup/imagga.png" alt="Imagga" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a> is a cloud platform that helps businesses and 
individuals organize their images in a fast and cost-effective way. They 
develop a range of advanced proprietary image recognition and image processing
technologies, which are built into several services such as smart image
cropping, color extraction and multi-color search, visual similarity search and
auto-tagging.</p>
<p>During 
<a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">Balkan Venture Forum</a>
in Sofia I sat down with Georgi Kadrev to talk about technology.
Surprisingly this hi-tech service is built on top of standard low-tech components
and lots of hard work.</p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>Core functionality is developed in C and C++ with the OpenCV library. 
Imagga relies heavily on own image processing algorithms for their core
features. These were built as a combination of their own research activities
and publications from other researchers.</p>
<p>Image processing is executed by worker nodes configured with their own
software stack. Nodes are distributed among Amazon EC2 and other data centers.</p>
<p>Client libraries to access Imagga API are available in PHP, Ruby and Java.</p>
<p>Imagga has built several websites to showcase their technology.
<a href="http://cropp.me/">Cropp.me</a>, <a href="http://colorslike.me/">ColorsLike.me</a>,
<a href="http://www.stockpodium.com">StockPodium</a> and <a href="http://autotag.me/">AutoTag.me</a>
were built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery above a standard LAMP stack.</p>
<p>Recently Imagga also started using GPU computing with nVidia Tesla cards.
They use C++ and Python bindings for
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda">CUDA</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As an initially bootstrapping start-up we chose something that is basically free,
reliable and popular - that's why started with the LAMP stack. It proved to be
stable and convenient for our web needs and we preserved it.
The use of C++ is a natural choice for computational intensive tasks that we
need to perform for the purpose of our core expertise - image processing. 
Though we initially wrote the whole core technology code from scratch, we later
switched to OpenCV for some of the building blocks as it is very well optimized
and continuously extended image processing library.</p>
<p>With the raise of affordable high-performance GPU processors and their availability
in server instances, we decided it's time to take advantage of this highly parallel
architecture, perfectly suitable for image processing tasks.</p>

I will ask them to follow this thread and reply to your questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://retidoc.com/">RETiDoc</a> automates personal ID data entry, speeding up
customer service and eliminating costly errors. The product is based on OCR
algorithms and could be used on hardware devices scanning the ID card or
through a compact scanner box specially designed for the need. The main problem
tackled by RETiDoc is manual data entry at service providers, 
which is a time consuming, low-customer satisfaction process, filled with
expensive typos and low productivity at provider’s front offices.</p>
<p>Co-founder Martin Kulov takes us behind the scenes.</p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and <a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/">Team Foundation Service</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don't have the time to fill-in the details.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will do so in the future.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    Text To Speech for Bulgarian
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I've been exploring text-to-speech synthesizers for Bulgarian in the past
few weeks. I found only three. Here is my review and opinion about
two competitive companies, one of which lost me as a client.</p>
<h2>eSpeak</h2>
<p><a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a> is a compact open source software
speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>I'm using espeak-1.47.11-1, from Fedora - the src.rpm rebuilt on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6. Earlier versions do not support Bulgarian.</p>
<p>There is only one available voice for Bulgarian, which seems to have reasonably
good pronunciation. There are some errors though, it's not perfect. The voice
however is horrible. It's the worst computer generated voice of all solutions
I've found so far. </p>
<p>Good for initial testing since it requires virtually no setup and can be used
from the command line.</p>
<h2>SpeechLab 2.0</h2>
<p>SpeechLab is developed by the
<a href="http://www.bacl.org/speechlab.html">Bulgarian Association for Computational Linguistics</a>.
There's a sample of only one voice but I was told others can be added as well. Not sure about that.</p>
<p>Listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4s2UgwYgbkM">the sample</a>
I think this is the most correct synthesizer of all. The voice still sounds computerized
but better compared to eSpeak. The same voice is used by local TV channels when showing
news related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29">Anonymous</a> and
one could probably say it will be accepted by the general public if used into
a software product.</p>
<p>BACL has transferred the sales rights to a company called
<a href="http://aquasyst-eco.com/speechlab_2_0_server.html">Aquasyst-Eco</a> which claims to have
a desktop and a server product. The server version is supposed to work on Linux too.
There is also a <a href="http://slideme.org/application/speechlab-2-0">version for Android</a>.</p>
<p>Initially I thought to use SpeechLab but BACL and the trading vendor didn't make it
easy on me. There's virtually no documentation, all links to samples from the
official product pages are broken, they didn't reply to any of my emails
nor phone calls. </p>
<p>As much as I prefer working/using locally developed products (not only software)
I will never use SpeechLab because its creators don't give a fuck about customers.
Why should I give a fuck about the product then? </p>
<h2>Innoetics' SpeakVolumes</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.innoetics.com">Innoetics</a> is a Greek company, a spin-off of the
Institute of Language &amp; Speech Processing (ILSP) of ‘Athena’ Research Centre.
Something like BACL I suppose but a bit more commercially oriented. </p>
<p>Initially I though to use their TTS Batch product to produce audio samples
and asked for a demo. They were very quick in their response and gave me
an FTP download of the software, plus demo activation key and documentation. 
Via email they've sent me tons of info plus pricing and additional proposals.
I didn't even try this demo because it runs on Windows which I don't have.</p>
<p>It turned out Innoetics has built the <a href="http://www.speakvolumes.eu/">SpeakVolumes</a>
web service which has two modes of operation - on-the-fly audio generation 
using a SOAP based API and offline generation via the web site.
Pricing for SpeakVolumes (per words) was much more competitive than their Windows products
for my use case.</p>
<p>I've created an account at SpeakVolumes and they've bumped up my initial words
credit so I can give it a try. Works like a charm. </p>
<p>There is only one voice for Bulgarian called Irina
(<a href="http://www.innoetics.com/media/tts_irinademo_bg.mp3">sample</a>).
The voice is very soft, female voice, speaks slower compared to eSpeak
and SpeechLab and sounds very natural. It makes a few mistakes but
from a 250 words sample that I used only a couple were pronounced with
minor mistakes.</p>
<p>The web service generates a Base64 encoded MP3 file and returns it as
response to the client.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/6044724">See example Python script here</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that Innoetics involved with me very quickly and provided me with
demo accounts and all sorts of information about their products and the
web API makes SpeakVolumes my choice for Text-To-Speech conversion for Bulgarian.</p>
<h2>Ivona</h2>
<p>Andre Polykanine from the eSpeak mailing list told me about
<a href="http://www.ivona.com/en/">Ivona</a>. It is a Polish company and seems to 
have been acquired by Amazon now. Andre told me Ivona had planned Bulgarian
support some time ago, but now rejected it for some reason. They didn't
reply to my email though. </p>
<p>Have you seen other text-to-speech synthesizers for Bulgarian? Let me know
what are they and if you have tried them out.</p>

<p>People tend to think I have a dream job, when I tell them I don't go to the office. 
I will tell you a story about working from home, being a remotee and not having a
regular job. Welcome to the world of contracting and freelancing!</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Definitions taken from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>An <strong>employee</strong> contributes labor and expertise to an endeavor of an employer and is usually hired 
to perform specific duties which are packaged into a job. In most modern economies, the term 
"employee" refers to a specific defined relationship between an individual and a corporation, 
which differs from those of customer or client.</p>
<p>An <strong>independent contractor</strong> is a natural person, business, or corporation that provides goods
or services to another entity under terms specified in a contract or within a verbal agreement.</p>
<p>A <strong>freelancer</strong> is somebody who is self-employed and is not committed to a particular employer long term.
For the purpose of this article this is more or less the same as independent contractor but for
a short-term project.</p>
<p>Most important of all is that a contractor or freelancer is a separate entity from the organization they work for.</p>
<h2>How I became a contractor</h2>
<p>5+ years ago I was an employee for Red Hat in Czech Republic, but didn't want to
permanently live there for many reasons. During my time abroad I was a frequent
traveler. I became comfortable working on the go and quite often my bosses didn't
know where I was. Most importantly I made sure that location didn't matter!</p>
<p>After 1.5 years I left the company with an option to continue working for
Red Hat Switzerland as a contractor. This is how I started working from home.</p>
<h2>The dark side</h2>
<p>Many people think working from home is easy. Many think being a contractor
is better than being an employee. Many think being away from the office means
you will work less. Many think you will make more money. <strong>Most people are wrong!</strong> </p>
<p>I will highlight the bad side of
being a contractor before exposing you to the goodies. Read the next parts before
even thinking to quit your job.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Contracting or freelancing is much more different than having a regular job.
If you are lucky you will have a long-term project and have a somewhat regular
income. On the other hand freelancing is usually the term used when working on
smaller short-term projects. They are irregular, so is your income. </p>
<p>You need to plan in advance your expenses and make sure your income will cover them.
This is a lot easier with long-term projects. </p>
<p>Also have in mind that contracts and projects can be delayed, terminated and postponed
relatively easy on behalf of the customer and there isn't much you can do. At best they have
already paid you for the job done until now and you are out looking for the next customer.</p>
<p>Longer-term contracts I've been working on had the option to terminate without any explanation
given in two to four weeks. This is a risk you have to accept and have a contingency plan
if your income depends on a single long-term project.</p>
<p>You either get paid by the hour or a lump sum on predefined milestone (e.g. half before, half after delivery).
Either way you trade time for money which isn't optimal (same thing do employees btw).
The best thing you can do is become an expert in your field and begin consulting.
This is trading less time plus expertise for more money - much better.</p>
<p>I've been doing QA consulting for other smaller clients as odd jobs since forever.
Some of the companies include <a href="http://obecto.com">Obecto</a> and
<a href="http://opencode.com">Opencode Systems</a>. I also consult start-ups in the
field of software testing and quality assurance.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> at the end of 2015 I've been engaged more frequently with the
engineering team at <a href="http://tradeo.com">Tradeo</a>, bringing them my QA expertise.</p>
<h2>Employee benefits</h2>
<p>Employees do get a lot of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christmas bonus</li>
<li>Quarterly bonus if the company is doing well</li>
<li>Performance oriented bonuses</li>
<li>25 days of paid vacation which increase the longer you work</li>
<li>Extra health care</li>
<li>Unemployment insurance, social securities, etc.</li>
<li>Gym or other sport activities in the office</li>
<li>Lunch or some snacks at the office</li>
<li>Free car/cell phone/laptop, whatever</li>
</ul>
<p>The bigger and more people oriented the company the more the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Contractors get nothing!</strong> Your contract payment is the only thing you get.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a vacation - you don't get paid!</li>
<li>If you are sick - you don't get paid!</li>
<li>If you need equipment - you have to buy it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Get used to it and plan accordingly! That said I do use company sponsored
<a class="wikilink" href="http://amzn.to/1RdviyD">MacBook Air</a> and have a small budget for visiting some conferences
abroad. In addition I attend lot more <a href="/blog/category/events/">events</a>
on my own either by helping as volunteer or being a speaker at the event.
I also have a personal unemployment and extra health care insurance, in fact
several of them, just in case!</p>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>In every country dealing with tax authorities is a hell. If you are a sole proprietor in
Bulgaria chances are you will pay more taxes and social securities compared to being a
company for the same revenue. If you can, always incorporate a company and contract through it.
As of late <strong>all</strong> of my income goes through the company entity, I don't receive
a single cent on my personal account. At the end of the year I pay myself a divident
and use the money during the next year.</p>
<p>Find a good accountant (as much as you can afford though) and make sure they know everything
about your income and activities. It's always better to hire an accounting company which
can grant you some protection and liability against prosecution from tax authorities - for example
if they get their calculation wrong. The extent of this should be written in a contract. </p>
<p>If necessary also hire a lawyer. If you deal with lots of paperwork and contracts (or NDAs)
this is definitely a wise thing to do. Don't spare your money, spare yourself going to jail.</p>
<h2>Work environment</h2>
<p>Working from your bedroom sounds cool but it isn't. You need a quiet and comfortable
place to work. Every-day house distractions are your worst enemy. You need much greater
discipline compared to working in an office. </p>
<p>My own work environment has evolved to having the best 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=computer%20chairs&linkCode=ur2&sprefix=computer%20chairs%2Caps%2C318&tag=atodorovorg-20&url=search-alias%3Doffice-products">office chair</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
from Sweden, custom designed furniture to make my life easier
and access stuff more quickly, maximum usage of storage space at home,
SOHO network designed by myself so that every device has its place and plug,
backup Internet connections, etc. <strong>You need to invest in your work space to reap the benefits later</strong>.</p>
<p>I also follow a strict regime and have some fixed hours for work and no-work related activities.
I split them between regular 9-5 business hours and evening/early morning to have more
flexibility. Whatever the case you have to plan your activities and stick to your plan.</p>
<p>In the office there's always time for a coffee or some chit-chat.
At home there is not. Every hour counts to your bonus so it is in your interest to log
as many hours as possible and perform actual work during them. There are some freelance websites
such as oDesk (which sucks btw) that require you to install software to monitor your screen,
camera and keyboard in order the customer to see you were actually working. </p>
<p>Beware that there are physical limits which you can't break without putting your health
at risk. I've tried working 200+ hours a month. It is doable once or twice a year when you
have lot of things to do. But you can't do it all the time. I've tried, trust me.</p>
<p>Another important thing is the social element. Being out of the office minimizes the opportunities
to socialize with co-workers or simply ask for help. A contractor needs some other way to
compensate for this - being part of special interest groups, attending events and the like. </p>
<h2>No customers risk</h2>
<p>As with every business there is a risk of not having the right customers or not having them
at all. There are several things you can do to minimize this risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be an expert in at least one field - this is your primary focus; For example: 
I'm an expert in Quality Engineering and Red Hat Enterprise Linux;</li>
<li>Become very good professional in few more fields - mine are cloud computing,
Python and Django and general open source programming;</li>
<li>Grow your network of friends, co-workers, IT professionals and possible customers -
you never know where the next customer will come from;</li>
<li>Stay current with popular technologies (no need to be expert) so you can learn quickly if
the need arises;</li>
<li>Have some backup skills where there isn't much competition and customers will have a hard time
finding the right guy. Also make sure you know where to find these customers. My skill is
Pascal - its an old language but there are lots of legacy software which still needs to be
maintained. Did you know you can even run COBOL in the cloud these days? </li>
</ul>
<p>Diversify and be flexible - you have the opportunity to generate income from
various sources - use it. I will tell you about mine in the next part of this article.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.balkanventureforum.org/">Balkan Venture Forum</a> in Sofia is over. It's been two
very exciting days, full of many interesting talks both on stage and off stage.</p>
<p>There were so many things that happened and so many new people I met that it will be hard
to mention all of that in a single blog post. I just want to highlight the things I enjoyed
the most.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Networking &amp; pitching at the bar</h2>
<p>I've been invited to BkVF long ago. However my initial intention was not to attend because
this month proved to be very busy. I've changed my mind after Boyan Benev, one of the organizers
invited me 10 days ago with an interesting proposal - distribute <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>'s beer mats at the bar!</p>
<p><img src="/images/difio_beermats.jpg" alt="Difio beer mats" style="float:left;clear:both;display:inline-block;"/></p>
<p>So I was there for the networking. As I used to say when people asked me if I was pitching</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am pitching at the bar!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Networking was very intensive both during the coffee breaks and cocktail and during the sessions.
I've now got close to 50 new business cards in my pocket. I've met very cool guys and gals both
developers and non-tech. </p>
<p>From the companies that were pitching in the main hall I particularly liked
<a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a>, <a href="http://transmetrics.eu/">Transmetrics</a> and <a href="http://kimola.com/">Kimola</a>.
Imagga was probably the most deep-tech/science oriented company at BkVF while Transmetrics
and Kimola focus on cloud and big data solutions.</p>
<h2>BlackBerry development session</h2>
<p>OK, I'm not into mobile technology nor smart phones but that may change soon. 
BlackBerry had a strong presence and I was able to talk to some of their developer
support folks.
The OS of BlackBerry 10 is based on QNX kernel with multiple SDKs available to write apps.
Most of all I like the fact that it is POSIX compliant with C/C++ native SDK available.
Qt/QML is also available. </p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in how hard it will be to port
some existing open source tools to BlackBerry. I'm talking Bash, Python and the
command line tools I currently use on Linux. I'll be contacting them in the near future
to get a device for testing and hacking and will keep you posted.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    Why Instagram Could Not Be Founded In Europe
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><em>Can a company like Instagram be founded in Europe and successfully exit for
$ 1 billion?</em> What do you think ?</p>
<p>This is precisely the question <a href="http://speedupgroup.com/about-us/">Bartłomiej Gola</a>
asked at WebIT BG last week. Here are his answers.</p>
<h2>Theory says yes</h2>
<p>In theory Europe is well suited for successful companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have talented software engineers and hackers;</li>
<li>Great ideas are available everywhere;</li>
<li>Funding is available - both early stage seed funding as well
as VCs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Forget about it</h2>
<p>The short answer though is "forget about it"! There are several
major differences between Europe and Silicon Valley which
could break your start-up easily.</p>
<p>1) Europe doesn't have a strong branding with respect to technology.
We are not perceived as a strong tech community which produces great things.
Not to mention individual countries like Bulgaria.
This means foreign investors are
less likely to invest in European companies because they haven't heard
about other successful companies coming from the region.</p>
<p>We as a community should work together and popularize the region
(especially South Eastern Europe). I've seen this already in action.
German cloud provider <a href="http://cloudcontrol.de">cloudControl</a> has
branded their website as "Proudly Made In Berlin".</p>
<p>2) The lack of reputation leads to the second issue - less followers
on social media. Think about it! How many people in the US or Silicon Valley
do you follow on Twitter? How many follow you back? How many of those who
do, actually engage with what you share? </p>
<p>With some exceptions like my friend <a href="http://batsov.com">Bozhidar Batsov</a> your
social reach is quite limited when it comes to hi-tech users.</p>
<p>3) Less reputation plus less social reach means less buzz and less early
adopters. Silicon Valley is a great place to generate buzz and find
early adopters. Because of the software industry and many start-ups
located in the area people generally have more open mindset and
will try out new ideas, share valuable feedback, engage in social media
and spread the word.</p>
<p>Early adopters are crucial for every start-up. And we don't have this 
mindset in Europe. I have seen it myself. From 400 friends and co-workers
whom I've contacted via LinkedIn, half or more of them in Europe,
only a few, not even a dozen have tried <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>.
And we are talking about service from developers about developers. Nada.</p>
<p>I've tried another experiment as well. This time about non IT business.
From around 100 female friends on Facebook around 10 followed a 
<a href="http://facebook.com/obuvki41plus">Facebook page</a>
which I've invited them to. The page is 
<a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">online ladies shoes shop</a>.</p>
<h2>What to do about it?</h2>
<p>I don't have a clear answer here. We need to work hard and
make Europe and Bulgaria well known in the software industry
and start-up community. I encourage everyone to try, fail, try, fail
and try until they succeed. And brag about what you do all the time.</p>
<p>This also prompted me another question. "How do companies in the Bulgarian
start-up eco-system find their early adopters?" I think I'm gonna start
a new blog category  dedicated to this topic.</p>
<p>Is your company the next Instagram? Please use the comments and tell me.</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img src="/images/startup/deed.jpg" alt="Deed" style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ideedit.com/">Deed</a> is an action-provoking platform for challenging
yourself and others and also a business solution for improved engagement by the
corresponding communities. It solves the problem of passivity by converting people
who “Like” to people who “Act. The challenge format gives businesses an effective,
fresh and low-cost solution to maintain active connection with their communities
and measure engagement.</p>
<p>Emil Stoychev explains their technical background.</p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>Deed is built around Microsoft technologies plus some open source libraries.</p>
<p>Their web application and API is built with ASP.NET MVC 3 using MS SQL 2008 database engine.
Deed is hosted on a single cloud server at Rackspace and uses Akamai CDN for static files
distribution. At the moment the team is testing Windows Azure cloud platform and plans
migrating there.</p>
<p>A native Windows Phone application also exists.</p>
<p>Lots of JavaScript and CSS frameworks come to play at the  web interface layer like
jQuery, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> for templates and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a>.</p>
<p>IDE of choice is Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for C# and Vim for everything else.
Source code revision control is managed with Mercurial and build scripts are written in Python.</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deed team had experience with Microsoft technologies initially so it was natural
for us to choose this stack. While not perfect and costly in terms of hosting fees,
it serves its purpose for the moment. When you start a new project and you want to get
up and running fast your best choice is to use what you already mastered.
That in our case was the Microsoft stack.</p>
<p>Emil Stoychev</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed I strongly support this! Always use technologies you are a master at and change and
adapt along the way if necessary.</p>

I will ask them to follow this thread and reply to your questions.</p>

<p>The process is really easy. Homeowners post jobs on the website and receive
offers from relevant tradesmen. After the job is done homeowners leave feedback
and recommendations. With this feature homeowners can compare tradesmen profiles,
offers and ratings and confidently choose who they want to hire.</p>
<p>The team is also runner up at the Start IT Smart
<a href="http://www.3challenge.com/startups/season-3/">3Challenge</a>.
<a href="http://meisterplus.com/about/team">Boris Sanchez</a> shared their technical mojo.</p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>Main technologies used are PHP, Symfony 2.1 and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>MaistorPlus is a traditional web platform developed with the
<a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony framework</a>. Web pages are rendered by Twig -
a straightforward, flexible and easy to extend templating engine, which is 
integrated into the Symfony framework by default and works server-side with PHP
in order to generate dynamic content, based on data stored in the database.
Web pages also use jQuery and <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle.js</a> and feature modern graphics.
Everything is beautifully styled with CSS.</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The original development team already had experience with Symfony, Zend, Spring and
some other web application development frameworks. We opted for Symfony for two
main reasons. First, Symfony is constantly improving, and has a strong and
continuously growing community that offers 3rd party add-on components for free.
Second, PHP is a bit easier to "learn as you go" then Java. The members of our
design team didn't have a lot of prior programming experience, so we wanted to
make sure we set a low barrier of entry for them, as we didn't have the enough
development staff to have a distinct separation between design creation and design
integration in our team.</p>
<p>For the initial prototype we used the MySQL database management system. After a
while we wanted to add spatial features to the business logic, and discovered that
MySQL does not have proper support for spatial indexing. We therefore decided to
migrate to PostgreSQL, which supports spatial data with add-ons like PostGIS.</p>

<p><a href="http://ucha.se/">Ucha.se</a> makes learning fun. It is an online platform,
on which pupils and students learn and prepare for school. Pupils learn faster,
improve their results and get inspired. The platform allows students to watch
videos, take tests, ask questions and share comments. Learning is represented
with gamification components like drawings, playful narration, dashboards with
the best students, etc. It is available on the web and is extending to mobile.
Ucha.se is well recognized by the parents and teachers in Bulgaria.
In November 2012 Ucha.se was awarded as the best website in Bulgaria in the
field of Education and Science.</p>
<p>Nikolay Zheynov is leading the IT team which maintains and expands the web platform.
He shared with me some of the internals.</p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>Main technologies used are PHP, MySQL, Nginx, jQuery and jQueryUI.</p>
<p>Server-side development is done with PHP 5. The main reason for choosing PHP is
that the IT team working on the platform had long experience with the language.
Ucha.se has developed their own PHP framework which is constantly expanding.
This allows flexible programming and easier application maintenance.
Nginx is the web server of choice.</p>
<p>MySQL 5 is used for the database because PHP + MySQL is like bread and butter.
While the site usage was growing the team had to optimize their DB layer and switched
from MyISAM storage engine to InnoDB.</p>
<p>On the client-side standard web technologies are used - HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The main goal when doing the website design was to match expectation from different
user groups - pupils, teachers, parents and students.
jQuery and jQueryUI are widely used on the client side.</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>True to our agile approach to incrementally enhance the product and the technology
that goes along with it, we strongly believe in the scaling on demand practices.
Ucha.se's own framework reflects exactly to that. It allows us to meet our growing
user demands and provides at the same time, the dev-team with enough flexibility to
quickly react on new business opportunities and technological (r)evolutions.</p>

                <p>I am starting a new section called 
<a href="/blog/categories/what-runs/">What Runs Your Start-up</a> where I will
write about the technologies running behind some interesting
start-up companies and why they made their technological choices.
The articles will be short and to the point. Interested readers
can engage in discussion with start-up owners in the comments later.</p>
<p>I am starting with a dozen companies from the Bulgarian start-up eco-system
and will present one or two start-ups per week.

<p><a href="http://usefulatnight.com/">Useful at Night</a> is a mobile guide for nightlife
empowering real time discovery of cool locations, allowing nightlife players
to identify opinion leaders. Through geo-location and data aggregation
capabilities, the application allows useful exploration of cities, places and
parties.</p>
<p><a href="http://about.me/velev">Evelin Velev</a> was kind enough to share what technologies
his team uses to run their star-up.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Main Technologies</h2>
<p>Main technologies used are Node.js, HTML 5 and NoSQL.</p>
<p>Back-end application servers are written in Node.js and hosted at Heroku,
coupled with <a href="http://www.redistogo.com/">RedisToGo</a> for caching and
CouchDB served by <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> for storage.</p>
<p>Their mobile front-end supports both iOS and Android platforms and is built using
HTML5 and a homemade UI framework called RAPID. There are some native parts developed
in Objective-C and Java respectively.</p>
<p>In addition <em>Useful at Night</em> uses MongoDB for metrics data with a custom metrics solution
written in Node.js; Amazon S3 for storing different assets; and a custom storage solution
called Divan (simple CouchDB like).</p>
<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We chose Node.js for our application servers, because it enables us to build efficient
distributed systems while sharing significant amounts of code between client and server.
Things get really interesting when you couple Node.js with Redis for data structure
sharing and message passing, as the two technologies play very well together.</p>
<p>We chose CouchDB as our main back-end because it is the most schema-less data-store that
supports secondary indexing. Once you get fluent with its map-reduce views, you can
compute an index out of practically anything. For comparison, even MongoDB requires
that you design your documents as to enable certain indexing patterns. Put otherwise,
we'd say CouchDB is a data-store that enables truly lean engineering - we have never had
to re-bake or migrate our data since day one, while we're constantly experimenting with
new ways to index, aggregate and query it.</p>
<p>We chose HTML5 as our front-end technology, because it's cross-platform and because we
believe it's ... almost ready. Things are still really problematic on Android, but iOS
boasts a gorgeous web presentation platform, and Windows 8 is also joining the game with
a very good web engine. Obviously we're constantly running into issues and limitations,
mostly related to the unfortunate fact that in spite of some recent developments,
a web app is still mostly single threaded. However, we're getting there, and we're proud
to say we're running a pretty graphically complex hybrid app with near-native GUI performance
on the iPhone 4S and above.</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <blockquote>
<p>Not all innovation needs to come out of Silicon Valley!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've just watched <a href="http://www.siliconprairiefilm.com/">Silicon Prairie</a>
(download for free or as much as you can afford).
Last fall, a team of journalists and activists joined reddit's Internet 2012 Bus Tour
and traveled from Denver, CO to Danville, KY to capture the Internet’s role in the 
US Midwest's growing Silicon Prairie. Nimblebot, a digital agency, shot and produced a
mini-documentary showcasing the journey. I particularly liked several companies listed
below.</p>
<h2>AgLocal</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.aglocal.com/">AgLocal</a> connects quality meat producers with high-margin
buyers. This can work very well in Bulgaria. Most food and agriculture producers in 
the country are small and mid-sized farms who struggle to sell their produce or work with
middlemen for a low margin. On the other hand there are more and more people, especially in
big cities who would like to pay for locally produced food but don't know where to buy it from
or don't have the time to visit a farm to buy it (like myself). Last but not least what big supermarket
chains sell is simply too expensive and crappy.</p>
<p>As far as I know there are several attempts at such kind of companies/organizations here
but they are small and not widely popular.</p>
<h2>Homes For Hackers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.homesforhackers.com/">Homes For Hackers</a> in Kansas City is offering 3 months
of rent-free, Google Fiber-connected start-up space to entrepreneurs. I have already heard
several people discussing similar ideas in Bulgaria, mostly because cost of living here,
hence cost of failure is very low. I wish them good luck.</p>
<h2>SparkFun Electronics</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun</a> is an online retail store that sells the bits and
pieces to make your electronics projects possible. According to the movie they create
open source hardware and even shipped to Antarctica which is cool.</p>
<p>Once again this business model can work in Bulgaria. We had lots of electronics produce back in the
past and still have. There is still talented people in this area
who will be looking for a job if their companies close shop due to Chinese competition.</p>
<p>Watch the movie and tell me which ones you like ? Do you think Bulgaria can have its
Silicon areas outside <a href="http://sofiavalley.com">Sofia Valley</a> ?</p>

                <p>Did you know there is a start-up company producing men's shoes? Me neither,
and I love good quality shoes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beckett Simonon launched in 2012, and slashed prices by working with local manufacturers and
selling directly to customers online.</p>
<p>The company, which currently operates out of Bogota, Colombia, says it has 
generated $80,000 in revenue after two months in operation, and has five employees.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Bailey_Chukka_Boot.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"/></p>
<p>From what I can tell <a href="http://www.beckettsimonon.com">Beckett Simonon</a> produce nice shoes.
I would rate them between very good and high quality, just looking at the pictures.
All designs are very classy and stylish, which is rare these days. Leather looks
high quality, soles too.</p>
<p>The ones I loved right away are the Bailey Chukka Boot model, shown here.
So far my gut feeling about shoes has never been wrong, even on the Internet, so
I'm thinking to pre-order a pair.</p>
<p>Anybody wants to team up for a joint order?</p>
