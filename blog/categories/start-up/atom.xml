    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my practice I like to use webhooks and integrate auxiliary services with
my internal processes or businesses. One of these is the collection of emails.
In this short article I'll show you an example of how to collect email addresses
from the comments of a WordPress.com blog and the UserVoice feedback/ticketing system.</p>

<h2>WordPress.com</h2>

<p>For your WordPress.com blog from the Admin Dashboard navigate to
Settings -> Webhooks and add a new webhook with action <code>comment_post</code>
and fields <code>comment_author</code>, <code>comment_author_email</code>. A simple
Django view that handles the input is shown below.</p>

<p><code>store_user_details()</code> is a function which handles the email/name received in the webhook,
possibly adding them to a database or anything else.</p>

<p>I find webhooks extremely easy to setup and develop and used them whenever they are
supported by the service provider. What other services do you use webhooks for? Please
share your story in the comments.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Book Review: UX for Lean Startups]]></title>
    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-09T10:09:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a>
and strongly recommend this book to anyone who is <strong>OR</strong> wants to be an
entrepreneur. Here is a short review of the book.</p>

<p>This book is for anyone who is creating a product/service or is considering the
idea of doing so. It talks about validation, interaction design and subsequent
product measurement and iteration. The book demonstrates some techniques and tools
to validate, design and measure your business ideas and products.
Its goal is to teach you how to design products that deliver fantastic user
experience, e.g. ones that are intuitive and easy to use.
It has nothing to do with visual design.</p>

<p>The author Laura Klein summarizes the book as follows:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>User research</p></p><p><pre><code>Listen to your users. All the time. I mean it.<br/></code></pre></p><p><p>Validation</p></p><p><pre><code>When you make assumptions or create hypotheses,<br/>test them before spending lots of time building products around them.<br/></code></pre></p><p><p>Design</p></p><p><pre><code>Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.<br/></code></pre></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Early Validation</h2>

<p>This chapter helped me a lot to understand what exactly is validation and how
to go about it. The flow is validating the problem you are trying to solve,
then the market and then the product.</p>

<p>I will also add that by using some of these research techniques around a
vague idea/area of interest you may come around a particular trend/pattern or problem
and develop your business from there.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You’ll know that you’ve validated a problem when you start to hear<br/>particular groups of people complaining about something specific.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>Your goal in validating your market is to begin to narrow down the<br/>group of people who will want their problems solved badly enough to buy<br/>your product. Your secondary goal is to understand exactly why they’re<br/>interested so you can find other markets that might be similarly motivated.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>You’ll know that you’ve successfully validated your market when you can<br/>accurately predict that a particular type of person will have a specific<br/>problem and that the problem will be severe enough that that person is<br/>interested in purchasing a solution.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>Just because you have discovered a real problem and have a group of people<br/>willing to pay you to solve their problem, that doesn’t necessarily mean that<br/>your product is the right solution.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>You’ll know that you’ve validated your product when a large percentage of<br/>your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>User Research</h2>

<p>Next few chapters talk about user research, the various kinds of it and when/how
to perform it. It talks how to properly run surveys, how to ask good questions,
etc.</p>

<h2>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>Quantitative research is about measuring what real people are actually<br/>doing with your product. It doesn’t involve speaking with specific humans.<br/>It’s about the data in aggregate. It should always be statistically significant.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>Quantitative research tells you <strong>what</strong> your problem is. Qualitative<br/>research tells you <strong>why</strong> you have that problem.</p></p><p><p>...</p></p><p><p>If you want to measure something that exists, like traffic or revenue or how<br/>many people click on a particular button, then you want quantitative data.<br/>If you want to know why you lose people out of your purchase funnel or<br/>why people all leave once they hit a specific page, or why people seem not<br/>to click that button, then you need qualitative.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Part Two: Design</h2>

<p>The second part of this book talks about design - everything from building a
prototype to figuring out when you don’t want one. It assumes you have validated
the initial idea and now move on to designing the product and validating that
design before you start building it. It talks about diagrams, sketches, wireframes,
prototypes and of course MVPs.</p>

<p>I think you can safely skip some of these steps when it comes to small applications
because it may be easier/faster to build the application instead of a prototype.
Definitely not to be skipped if you're building a more complex product!</p>

<h2>Part Three: Product</h2>

<p>This section talks about metrics and measuring the product once it is out of the door.
Supposedly based on these metrics you will refine your design and update the product
accordingly.  Most of the time it focuses on A/B testing and which metrics are
important and which are so called "vanity metrics".</p>

<p>I particularly liked the examples of A/B testing and explanations what it is good for
and what it does poorly. Definitely a mistake I've happened to made myself. I'm sure you too.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have read this book and what your thoughts are. Thanks!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/01/why-taking-orders-by-phone-works-for-my-start-up/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-01T09:48:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/01/why-taking-orders-by-phone-works-for-my-start-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I've
<a href="/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding/">mentioned</a>
a start-up project called
<a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">obuvki41plus.com</a> and that it accepts phone orders
instead of online electronic orders like everyone else. I will tell you why.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/phone_order.jpg" alt="Taking phone orders" style="clear:both;display:block;" />
<em>Image CC-BY <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/southernfoodwaysalliance/3291060837/">Southern Foodways Alliance</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://obuvki41plus.com/">obuvki41plus.com</a> is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus, which are hard to find in Bulgaria.
There is a shopping cart component on the website which at the end redirects to
a simple page with instructions how to order via phone. Why not online
orders like everyone else? Several reasons!</p>

<p>The business target group is very limited - women who wear large shoe size
and like the proposed shoe style and can afford the higher price (quality shoes
only, sorry). On top of
that the business model is <strong>online only</strong>. The rule of thumb is to <strong>make
everything possible to lower barrier to entry for customers</strong>!
Also don't make our lives harder in doing so.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phone ordering is the easiest way for customers in Bulgaria.
I myself often prefer it because of the too many steps and too many fields
to fill-in when ordering online. The reality is that most local websites
are horribly made with respect to user experience and many users are not
that fluent with Internet as it may seem. No need to get people frustrated
if they are about to spend their money with you!</p></li>
<li><p>Phone ordering, especially in the early business stage lets you know
your customers. This is invaluable feedback for you as the owner and you
can't get that from an online ordering system. It just doesn't work,
I've tried!</p></li>
<li><p>A phone ordering system is just so easy to implement. Later that can
be scaled with some automated IVR system and a call center; Or just
migrate it to online ordering system;</p></li>
<li><p>The website in question is supposed to be no-maintenance as much
as possible. It is static HTML and no database at all. Introducing
online ordering is just too much of a technological overhead in this case;</p></li>
<li><p>Last but probably most important is customer care - not only we want to
make it easy for them to order but want to prevent frequent returns
caused by wrong product expectations or incorrect size. After all shoes
need to be tried first.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So to summarize - the orders are taken in person via phone
including objection handling and questions answering. An order may consist
of up to 3 pairs of shoes which are shipped to the customer with the option
to try them out upon delivery! Buy all or just a pair - it's a customer call!
Small return fee is imposed to prevent abuse!</p>

<p>For that kind of business this seems to be the best solution so far.
I'd love to hear other owners experience and decision logic. Please use
the comments to tell us how you've organized the sales/ordering/delivery
process in your company and why so. Thanks!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/29/what-runs-your-startup-imagga/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-29T12:32:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/29/what-runs-your-startup-imagga</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/startup/imagga.png" alt="Imagga" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a> is a cloud platform that helps businesses and
individuals organize their images in a fast and cost-effective way. They
develop a range of advanced proprietary image recognition and image processing
technologies, which are built into several services such as smart image
cropping, color extraction and multi-color search, visual similarity search and
auto-tagging.</p>

<p>During
<a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">Balkan Venture Forum</a>
in Sofia I sat down with Georgi Kadrev to talk about technology.
Surprisingly this hi-tech service is built on top of standard low-tech components
and lots of hard work.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Core functionality is developed in C and C++ with the OpenCV library.
Imagga relies heavily on own image processing algorithms for their core
features. These were built as a combination of their own research activities
and publications from other researchers.</p>

<p>Image processing is executed by worker nodes configured with their own
software stack. Nodes are distributed among Amazon EC2 and other data centers.</p>

<p>Client libraries to access Imagga API are available in PHP, Ruby and Java.</p>

<p>Imagga has built several websites to showcase their technology.
<a href="http://cropp.me/">Cropp.me</a>, <a href="http://colorslike.me/">ColorsLike.me</a>,
<a href="http://www.stockpodium.com">StockPodium</a> and <a href="http://autotag.me/">AutoTag.me</a>
were built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery above a standard LAMP stack.</p>

<p>Recently Imagga also started using GPU computing with nVidia Tesla cards.
They use C++ and Python bindings for
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda">CUDA</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>As an initially bootstrapping start-up we chose something that is basically free,<br/>reliable and popular - that's why started with the LAMP stack. It proved to be<br/>stable and convenient for our web needs and we preserved it.<br/>The use of C++ is a natural choice for computational intensive tasks that we<br/>need to perform for the purpose of our core expertise - image processing.<br/>Though we initially wrote the whole core technology code from scratch, we later<br/>switched to OpenCV for some of the building blocks as it is very well optimized<br/>and continuously extended image processing library.</p></p><p><p>With the raise of affordable high-performance GPU processors and their availability<br/>in server instances, we decided it's time to take advantage of this highly parallel<br/>architecture, perfectly suitable for image processing tasks.</p><footer><strong>Georgi Kadrev</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://retidoc.com/">RETiDoc</a> automates personal ID data entry, speeding up
customer service and eliminating costly errors. The product is based on OCR
algorithms and could be used on hardware devices scanning the ID card or
through a compact scanner box specially designed for the need. The main problem
tackled by RETiDoc is manual data entry at service providers,
which is a time consuming, low-customer satisfaction process, filled with
expensive typos and low productivity at provider’s front offices.</p>

<p>Co-founder Martin Kulov takes us behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and <a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/">Team Foundation Service</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don't have the time to fill-in the details.</p>

<p>Hopefully they will do so in the future.</p>
