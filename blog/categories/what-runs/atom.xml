&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://imagga.com/"&gt;Imagga&lt;/a&gt; is a cloud platform that helps businesses and 
individuals organize their images in a fast and cost-effective way. They 
develop a range of advanced proprietary image recognition and image processing
technologies, which are built into several services such as smart image
cropping, color extraction and multi-color search, visual similarity search and
auto-tagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 
&lt;a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/"&gt;Balkan Venture Forum&lt;/a&gt;
in Sofia I sat down with Georgi Kadrev to talk about technology.
Surprisingly this hi-tech service is built on top of standard low-tech components
and lots of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core functionality is developed in C and C++ with the OpenCV library. 
Imagga relies heavily on own image processing algorithms for their core
features. These were built as a combination of their own research activities
and publications from other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image processing is executed by worker nodes configured with their own
software stack. Nodes are distributed among Amazon EC2 and other data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client libraries to access Imagga API are available in PHP, Ruby and Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagga has built several websites to showcase their technology.
&lt;a href="http://cropp.me/"&gt;Cropp.me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://colorslike.me/"&gt;ColorsLike.me&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.stockpodium.com"&gt;StockPodium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autotag.me/"&gt;AutoTag.me&lt;/a&gt;
were built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery above a standard LAMP stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Imagga also started using GPU computing with nVidia Tesla cards.
They use C++ and Python bindings for
&lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda"&gt;CUDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initially bootstrapping start-up we chose something that is basically free,
reliable and popular - that's why started with the LAMP stack. It proved to be
stable and convenient for our web needs and we preserved it.
The use of C++ is a natural choice for computational intensive tasks that we
need to perform for the purpose of our core expertise - image processing. 
Though we initially wrote the whole core technology code from scratch, we later
switched to OpenCV for some of the building blocks as it is very well optimized
and continuously extended image processing library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the raise of affordable high-performance GPU processors and their availability
in server instances, we decided it's time to take advantage of this highly parallel
architecture, perfectly suitable for image processing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgi Kadrev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and &lt;a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Team Foundation Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don't have the time to fill-in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully they will do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emil Stoychev explains their technical background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deed is built around Microsoft technologies plus some open source libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their web application and API is built with ASP.NET MVC 3 using MS SQL 2008 database engine.
Deed is hosted on a single cloud server at Rackspace and uses Akamai CDN for static files
distribution. At the moment the team is testing Windows Azure cloud platform and plans
migrating there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native Windows Phone application also exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of JavaScript and CSS frameworks come to play at the  web interface layer like
jQuery, &lt;a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/"&gt;Handlebars&lt;/a&gt; for templates and &lt;a href="http://lesscss.org/"&gt;Less CSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDE of choice is Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for C# and Vim for everything else.
Source code revision control is managed with Mercurial and build scripts are written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deed team had experience with Microsoft technologies initially so it was natural
for us to choose this stack. While not perfect and costly in terms of hosting fees,
it serves its purpose for the moment. When you start a new project and you want to get
up and running fast your best choice is to use what you already mastered.
That in our case was the Microsoft stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil Stoychev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed I strongly support this! Always use technologies you are a master at and change and
adapt along the way if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://meisterplus.com/about/team"&gt;Boris Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; shared their technical mojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main technologies used are PHP, Symfony 2.1 and PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MaistorPlus is a traditional web platform developed with the
&lt;a href="http://symfony.com/"&gt;Symfony framework&lt;/a&gt;. Web pages are rendered by Twig -
a straightforward, flexible and easy to extend templating engine, which is 
integrated into the Symfony framework by default and works server-side with PHP
in order to generate dynamic content, based on data stored in the database.
Web pages also use jQuery and &lt;a href="http://sizzlejs.com/"&gt;Sizzle.js&lt;/a&gt; and feature modern graphics.
Everything is beautifully styled with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original development team already had experience with Symfony, Zend, Spring and
some other web application development frameworks. We opted for Symfony for two
main reasons. First, Symfony is constantly improving, and has a strong and
continuously growing community that offers 3rd party add-on components for free.
Second, PHP is a bit easier to "learn as you go" then Java. The members of our
design team didn't have a lot of prior programming experience, so we wanted to
make sure we set a low barrier of entry for them, as we didn't have the enough
development staff to have a distinct separation between design creation and design
integration in our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the initial prototype we used the MySQL database management system. After a
while we wanted to add spatial features to the business logic, and discovered that
MySQL does not have proper support for spatial indexing. We therefore decided to
migrate to PostgreSQL, which supports spatial data with add-ons like PostGIS.&lt;/p&gt;

Ucha.se is well recognized by the parents and teachers in Bulgaria.
In November 2012 Ucha.se was awarded as the best website in Bulgaria in the
field of Education and Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikolay Zheynov is leading the IT team which maintains and expands the web platform.
He shared with me some of the internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main technologies used are PHP, MySQL, Nginx, jQuery and jQueryUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server-side development is done with PHP 5. The main reason for choosing PHP is
that the IT team working on the platform had long experience with the language.
Ucha.se has developed their own PHP framework which is constantly expanding.
This allows flexible programming and easier application maintenance.
Nginx is the web server of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL 5 is used for the database because PHP + MySQL is like bread and butter.
While the site usage was growing the team had to optimize their DB layer and switched
from MyISAM storage engine to InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the client-side standard web technologies are used - HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The main goal when doing the website design was to match expectation from different
user groups - pupils, teachers, parents and students.
jQuery and jQueryUI are widely used on the client side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to our agile approach to incrementally enhance the product and the technology
that goes along with it, we strongly believe in the scaling on demand practices.
Ucha.se's own framework reflects exactly to that. It allows us to meet our growing
user demands and provides at the same time, the dev-team with enough flexibility to
quickly react on new business opportunities and technological (r)evolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

his team uses to run their star-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main technologies used are Node.js, HTML 5 and NoSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back-end application servers are written in Node.js and hosted at Heroku,
coupled with &lt;a href="http://www.redistogo.com/"&gt;RedisToGo&lt;/a&gt; for caching and
CouchDB served by &lt;a href="https://cloudant.com/"&gt;Cloudant&lt;/a&gt; for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mobile front-end supports both iOS and Android platforms and is built using
HTML5 and a homemade UI framework called RAPID. There are some native parts developed
in Objective-C and Java respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition &lt;em&gt;Useful at Night&lt;/em&gt; uses MongoDB for metrics data with a custom metrics solution
written in Node.js; Amazon S3 for storing different assets; and a custom storage solution
called Divan (simple CouchDB like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Something Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose Node.js for our application servers, because it enables us to build efficient
distributed systems while sharing significant amounts of code between client and server.
Things get really interesting when you couple Node.js with Redis for data structure
sharing and message passing, as the two technologies play very well together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose CouchDB as our main back-end because it is the most schema-less data-store that
supports secondary indexing. Once you get fluent with its map-reduce views, you can
compute an index out of practically anything. For comparison, even MongoDB requires
that you design your documents as to enable certain indexing patterns. Put otherwise,
we'd say CouchDB is a data-store that enables truly lean engineering - we have never had
to re-bake or migrate our data since day one, while we're constantly experimenting with
new ways to index, aggregate and query it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose HTML5 as our front-end technology, because it's cross-platform and because we
believe it's ... almost ready. Things are still really problematic on Android, but iOS
boasts a gorgeous web presentation platform, and Windows 8 is also joining the game with
a very good web engine. Obviously we're constantly running into issues and limitations,
mostly related to the unfortunate fact that in spite of some recent developments,
a web app is still mostly single threaded. However, we're getting there, and we're proud
to say we're running a pretty graphically complex hybrid app with near-native GUI performance
on the iPhone 4S and above.&lt;/p&gt;
