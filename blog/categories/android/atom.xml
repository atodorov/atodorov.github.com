<p><a href="http://usefulatnight.com/">Useful at Night</a> is a mobile guide for nightlife
empowering real time discovery of cool locations, allowing nightlife players
to identify opinion leaders. Through geo-location and data aggregation
capabilities, the application allows useful exploration of cities, places and
parties.</p>

<p><a href="http://about.me/velev">Evelin Velev</a> was kind enough to share what technologies
his team uses to run their star-up.</p>

<br/>


<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Main technologies used are Node.js, HTML 5 and NoSQL.</p>

<p>Back-end application servers are written in Node.js and hosted at Heroku,
coupled with <a href="http://www.redistogo.com/">RedisToGo</a> for caching and
CouchDB served by <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> for storage.</p>

<p>Their mobile front-end supports both iOS and Android platforms and is built using
HTML5 and a homemade UI framework called RAPID. There are some native parts developed
in Objective-C and Java respectively.</p>

<p>In addition <em>Useful at Night</em> uses MongoDB for metrics data with a custom metrics solution
written in Node.js; Amazon S3 for storing different assets; and a custom storage solution
called Divan (simple CouchDB like).</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>We chose Node.js for our application servers, because it enables us to build efficient<br/>distributed systems while sharing significant amounts of code between client and server.<br/>Things get really interesting when you couple Node.js with Redis for data structure<br/>sharing and message passing, as the two technologies play very well together.</p></p><p><p>We chose CouchDB as our main back-end because it is the most schema-less data-store that<br/>supports secondary indexing. Once you get fluent with its map-reduce views, you can<br/>compute an index out of practically anything. For comparison, even MongoDB requires<br/>that you design your documents as to enable certain indexing patterns. Put otherwise,<br/>we'd say CouchDB is a data-store that enables truly lean engineering - we have never had<br/>to re-bake or migrate our data since day one, while we're constantly experimenting with<br/>new ways to index, aggregate and query it.</p></p><p><p>We chose HTML5 as our front-end technology, because it's cross-platform and because we<br/>believe it's ... almost ready. Things are still really problematic on Android, but iOS<br/>boasts a gorgeous web presentation platform, and Windows 8 is also joining the game with<br/>a very good web engine. Obviously we're constantly running into issues and limitations,<br/>mostly related to the unfortunate fact that in spite of some recent developments,<br/>a web app is still mostly single threaded. However, we're getting there, and we're proud<br/>to say we're running a pretty graphically complex hybrid app with near-native GUI performance<br/>on the iPhone 4S and above.</p></blockquote></p>
