                    Speeding Up Celery Backends, Part 3
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In the second part of this article we've seen 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/07/speeding-up-celery-backends-part-2/">how slow Celery actually is</a>.
Now let's explore what happens inside and see if we can't speed things up.</p>
<p>I've used <a href="http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/latest/">pycallgraph</a> to create
call graph visualizations of my application. It has the nice feature to also show
execution time and use different colors for fast and slow operations.</p>
<p>Full command line is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pycallgraph -v --stdlib --include ... graphviz -o calls.png -- ./manage.py celery_load_test
</pre></div>


<p>where the <code>--include</code> is used to limit the graph to a particular Python module(s).</p>
<h2>General findings</h2>
<p><img alt="call graph" src="/images/celery/general.png" title="call graph" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The first four calls is where most of the time is spent as seen on the picture. </li>
<li>As it seems most of the slow down comes from Celery itself, not the underlying messaging
transport Kombu (not shown on picture)</li>
<li><code>celery.app.amqp.TaskProducer.publish_task</code> takes half of the execution time of
<code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code></li>
<li><code>celery.app.task.Task.delay</code> directly executes <code>.apply_async</code> and can be skipped if one
rewrites the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More findings</h2>
<p>In <code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code> there is this block of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>349         with self.producer_or_acquire(producer) as P:
350             self.backend.on_task_call(P, task_id)
351             task_id = P.publish_task(
352                 name, args, kwargs, countdown=countdown, eta=eta,
353                 task_id=task_id, expires=expires,
354                 callbacks=maybe_list(link), errbacks=maybe_list(link_error),
355                 reply_to=reply_to or self.oid, **options
356             )
</pre></div>


<p><code>producer</code> is always None because delay() doesn't pass it as argument.
I've tried passing it explicitly to apply_async() as so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">djapp.celery</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

<span class="c"># app = debug_task._get_app() # if not defined in djapp.celery</span>
<span class="n">producer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">amqp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">producer_pool</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">acquire</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">debug_task</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apply_async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">producer</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">producer</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However this doesn't speedup anything. If we replace the above code block like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>349         with producer as P:
</pre></div>


<p>it blows up on the second iteration because producer and its channel is already None !?!</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the with statement in Python please read
<a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm">this article</a>. In short the with statement is
a compact way of writing try/finally. The underlying <code>kombu.messaging.Producer</code> class does a
<code>self.release()</code> on exit of the with statement.</p>
<p>I also tried killing the with statement and using producer directly but with limited success. While
it was not released(was non None) on subsequent iterations the memory usage grew much more and there
wasn't any performance boost.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The with statement is used throughout both Celery and Kombu and I'm not at all sure if
there's a mechanism for keep-alive connections. My time constraints are limited and I'll probably
not spend anymore time on this problem soon.</p>
<p>Since my use case involves task producer and consumers on localhost I'll try to workaround the
current limitations by using Kombu directly 
(see <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">this gist</a>) with a transport that
uses either a UNIX domain socket or a name pipe (FIFO) file.</p>

                    Speeding up Celery Backends, Part 2
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In the <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">first part</a> of this
post I looked at a few celery backends and discovered they didn't meet my needs.
Why is the Celery stack slow? How slow is it actually?</p>
<h2>How slow is Celery in practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Queue: 500`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Kombu:  14`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Celery:  2`000 msg/sec</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed test description</h2>
<p>There are three main components of the Celery stack: </p>
<ul>
<li>Celery itself</li>
<li>Kombu which handles the transport layer</li>
<li>Python Queue()'s underlying everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">Queue and Kombu tests</a>
run for 1 000 000 messages I got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw Python Queue: Msgs per sec: 500`000</li>
<li>Raw Kombu without Celery where <code>kombu/utils/__init__.py:uuid()</code> is set to return 0<ul>
<li>with json serializer: Msgs per sec: 5`988</li>
<li>with pickle serializer: Msgs per sec: 12`820</li>
<li>with the custom mem_serializer from <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">part 1</a>:
Msgs per sec: 14`492</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> when the test is executed with 100K messages mem_serializer yielded
25`000 msg/sec then the performance is saturated. I've observed similar behavior 
with raw Python Queue()'s. I saw some cache buffers being managed internally to avoid OOM
exceptions. This is probably the main reason performance becomes saturated over a longer
execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a> modified to
loop 1 000 000 times I got 1908.0 tasks created per sec.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting this worth outlining - in the kombu test there are these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>with producers[connection].acquire(block=True) as producer:
    for j in range(1000000):
</pre></div>


<p>If we swap them the performance drops down to 3875 msg/sec which is comparable with the
Celery results. Indeed inside Celery there's the same <code>with producer.acquire(block=True)</code>
construct which is executed every time a new task is published. Next I will be looking 
into this to figure out exactly where the slowliness comes from.</p>

                    Speeding up Celery Backends, Part 1
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I'm working on an application which fires a lot of Celery tasks - the more
the better! Unfortunately Celery backends seem to be rather slow :(.
Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a>
command for Django I was able to capture some metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon SQS backend: 2 or 3 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Filesystem backend: 2000 - 2500 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Memory backend: around 3000 tasks/sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad but I need in the order of 10000 tasks created per sec!
The other noticeable thing is that memory backend isn't much faster compared to
the filesystem one! NB: all of these backends actually come from the kombu package.</p>
<h2>Why is Celery slow ?</h2>
<p>Using <code>celery_load_test.py</code> together with 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/05/performance-profiling-in-python-with-cprofile/">cProfile</a> I
was able to pin-point some problematic areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>kombu/transports/virtual/__init__.py</code>: class Channel.basic_publish() - does
self.encode_body() into base64 encoded string. Fixed with custom transport backend
I called fastmemory which redefines the body_encoding property:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@cached_property</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">body_encoding</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Celery uses json or pickle (or other) serializers to serialize the data.
While json yields between 2000-3000 tasks/sec, pickle does around 3500 tasks/sec.
Replacing with a custom serializer which just returns
the objects (since we read/write from/to memory) yields about 4000 tasks/sec tops:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">kombu.serialization</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">register</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">loads</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">s</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dumps</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">s</span>

<span class="n">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;mem_serializer&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dumps</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">loads</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">content_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;application/x-memory&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">content_encoding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;binary&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p><code>kombu/utils/__init__.py</code>: def uuid() - generates random unique identifiers
which is a slow operation. Replacing it with <code>return "00000000"</code> boosts performance
to 7000 tasks/sec.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that a constant UUID is not of any practical use but serves well to illustrate
how much does this function affect performance. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Subsequent executions of <code>celery_load_test</code> seem to report degraded performance even with
the most optimized transport backend. I'm not sure why is this. One possibility is the random
UUID usage in other parts of the Celery/Kombu stack which drains entropy on the system and
generating more random numbers becomes slower. If you know better please tell me!</p>
<p>I will be looking for a better understanding
of these IDs in Celery and hope to be able to produce a faster uuid() function. Then I'll be
exploring the transport stack even more in order to reach the goal of 10000 tasks/sec.
If you have any suggestions or pointers please share them in the comments.</p>

                    SNAKE is no Longer Needed to Run Installation Tests in Beaker
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>This is a quick status update for one of the pieces of
<a href="/blog/2013/11/19/open-source-quality-assurance-infrastructure-for-fedora-qa/">Fedora QA infrastructure</a>
and mostly a self-note.</p>
<p>Previously to control the kickstart configuration used during installation in Beaker one
had to either modify the job XML in Beaker or use SNAKE (<code>bkr workflow-snake</code>) to render
a kickstart configuration from a Python template.</p>
<p>SNAKE presented challenges when deploying and using
<a href="https://beaker.fedoraproject.org">beaker.fedoraproject.org</a> and is
virtually unmaintained.</p>
<p>I present the new <code>bkr workflow-installer-test</code> which uses Jinja2 templates to
generate a kickstart configuration when provisioning the system. This is already
available in beaker-client-0.17.1.</p>
<p>The templates make use of all Jinja2 features (as far as I can tell) so you can create
very complex ones. You can even include snippets from one template into another if required.
The standard context that is passed to the template is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISTRO</strong> - if specified, the distro name</li>
<li><strong>FAMILY</strong> - as returned by Beaker server, e.g. <em>RedHatEnterpriseLinux6</em></li>
<li><strong>OS_MAJOR</strong> and <strong>OS_MINOR</strong> - also taken from Beaker server. e.g. OS_MAJOR=6 and OS_MINOR=5 for RHEL 6.5</li>
<li><strong>VARIANT</strong> - if specified</li>
<li><strong>ARCH</strong> - CPU architecture like x86_64</li>
<li>any parameters passed to the test job with <code>--taskparam</code>. They are processed last and can override previous values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation related tests at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fedoraqa/fedora-beaker-tests">fedora-beaker-tests</a>
have been updated with a <code>ks.cfg.tmpl</code> templates to use with this new workflow.</p>
<p>This workflow also has the ability to return boot arguments for the installer if needed. 
If any, they should be defined in a <code>{% block kernel_options %}{% endblock %}</code>
block inside the template. A simpler variant is to define a comment line that stars with
<em>## kernel_options:</em></p>
<p>There are still a few issues which need to be fixed before beaker.fedoraproject.org
can be used by the general public though. I will be writing another post about that
so stay tuned.</p>

                <p>Recently I wrote about <a href="/blog/2014/03/04/how-do-you-test-fonts/">testing fonts</a>.
I finally managed to get an answer from the authors of <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your approach for testing Fonts-TLWG?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not automated test. What it does is generate PDF with sample
texts at several sizes (the waterfall), pangrams, and glyph table.
It needs human eyes to investigate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of problems is your test suite designed for ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaping</li>
<li>Glyph coverage</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>We also make use of fontforge features to make spotting errors
easier, such as
- Show extremas
- Show almost vertical/horizontal lines/curves</p>

                    How do You Test Fonts
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><a href="/blog/2014/03/03/last-week-in-fedora-qa/">Previously</a> I mentioned about testing
fonts but didn't have any idea how this is done. Authors
Khaled Hosny of <a href="http://www.amirifont.org/">Amiri Font</a> and Steve White of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">GNU FreeFont</a> provided valuable insight
and material for further reading. I've asked them:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your approach for testing ?</li>
<li>What kind of problems is your test suite designed for ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently my test suite consists of text strings (or lists of code
points) and expected output glyph sequences and then use HarfBuzz
(through its hb-shape command line tool) to check that the fonts always
output the expected sequence of glyphs, sometimes with the expected
positioning as well. Amiri is a complex font that have many glyph
substitution and positioning rules, so the test suite is designed to
make sure those rules are always executed correctly to catch regressions
in the font (or in HarfBuzz, which sometimes happens since the things I
do in my fonts are not always that common).</p>
<p>I think Lohit project do similar testing for their fonts, and HarfBuzz
itself has a similar test suite with a bunch of nice scripts (though
they are not installed when building HarfBuzz, yet[1]).</p>
<p>Recently I added more kinds of tests, namely checking that OTS[2]
sanitizes the fonts successfully as this is important for using them on
the web, and a test for a common mistakes I made in my feature files
that result in unexpected blank glyphs in the fonts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer is complicated.  I'll do what I can to answer.</p>
<p>First, the FontForge application has a "verification" function which
can be run from a script, and which identifies numerous technical
problems.</p>
<p>FontForge also has a "Find Problems" function that I run by hand.</p>
<p>The monospaced face has special restrictions, first that all glyphs of
non-zero width must be of the same width, and second, that all glyphs
lie within the vertical bounds of the font.</p>
<p>Beside this, I have several other scripts that check for a few things
that FontForge doesn't (duplicate names, that glyph slots agree with
Unicode code within Unicode character blocks).</p>
<p>Several tests scripts have yet to be uploaded to the version control
system -- because I'm unsure of them.</p>
<p>There is a more complicated check of TrueType tables, which attempts
to find cases of tables that have been "shadowed" by the
script/language specification of another table.  This is helpful, but
works imperfectly.</p>
<p>ALL THAT SAID,</p>
<p>In the end, every script used in the font has to be visually checked.
This process takes me weeks, and there's nothing systematic about it,
except that I look at printout of documents in each language to see if
things have gone awry.</p>
<p>For a few documents in a few languages, I have images of how text
<em>should</em> look, and can compare that visually (especially important for
complex scripts.)</p>
<p>A few years back, somebody wrote a clever script that generated images
of text and compared them pixel-by-pixel.  This was a great idea, and
I wish I could use it more effectively, but the problem was that it
was much too sensitive.  A small change to the font (e.g. PostScript
parameters) would cause a small but global change in the rendering.
Also the rendering could vary from one version of the rendering
software to another.  So I don't use this anymore.</p>
<p>That's all I can think of right now.</p>
<p>In fact, testing has been a big problem in getting releases out.  In
the past, each release has taken at least two weeks to test, and then
another week to fix and bundle...if I was lucky.  And for the past
couple of years, I just haven't been able to justify the time
expenditure.  (Besides this, there are still a few serious problems
with the fonts--once again, a matter of time.)</p>
<p>Have a look at the bugs pages, to get an idea of work being done.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if ImageMagic or PIL can help solve the rendering and compare
problem Steve is talking about. They can definitely be used for
<a href="/blog/2013/05/17/linux-and-python-tools-to-compare-images/">image comparison</a>
so maybe coupled with some rendering library it's worth a quick try.</p>

                    Last Week in Fedora QA
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Here are some highlights from the past week discussions in Fedora which I found
interesting or participated in.</p>
<h2>Call to Action: Improving Overall Test Coverage in Fedora</h2>
<p>I can not stress enough how important it is to further
<a href="/blog/2014/02/28/action-improving-test-coverage-in-fedora/">improve test coverage in Fedora</a>!
You can help too. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join upstream and create a test suite for a package you find interesting;</li>
<li>Provide patches - <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-February/196035.html">first patch</a>
came in less than 30 minutes of initial announcement :);</li>
<li>Review packages in the wiki and help identify false negatives;</li>
<li>Forward to people who may be interested to work on these items;</li>
<li>Share and promote in your local open source and developer communities;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Auto BuildRequires</h2>
<p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/auto-buildrequires/">Auto-BuildRequires</a>
is a simple set of scripts which compliments <code>rpmbuild</code> by
automatically suggesting BuildRequires lines for the just built package.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have this integrated into Koji and/or
continuous integration environment and compare the output between every two
consecutive builds (iow older and newer package versions). It sounds like a
good way to identify newly added or removed dependencies and update the package
specs accordingly.</p>
<h2>How To Test Fonts Packages</h2>
<p>This is exactly what 
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-February/120570.html">Christopher Meng asked</a>
and frankly I have no idea. </p>
<p>I've come across a few fonts packages (<em>amiri-fonts</em>, <em>gnu-free-fonts</em> and <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>)
which seem to have some sort of test suites but I don't know how they work or
what type of problems they test for. On top of that all three have a different
way of doing things (e.g. not using a standardized test framework or a variation of such).</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on this once I manage to get more info from upstream developers.</p>
<h2>Is URL Field in RPM Useless</h2>
<p>So is it? Opinions here differ from totally useless to "don't remove it, I need it".
However I run a small test and from 2574 RPMs on the source DVD there is around 
40% of "something different than HTTP 200 OK". This means <strong>40% potentially broken URLs</strong>!</p>
<p>The majority are responses in the 3XX range and only less than 10% are 
actual errors (4XX, 5XX, missing URLs or connection errors).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this can be removed from <code>rpm</code> altogether.
I don't think it will happen soon but if we don't use it why have it there? </p>
<p>My script for the test is
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/test-rpm-url-field.sh">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Around Christmas 2013
<a href="/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/">I said</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it looks like on average 30% of the packages execute their test suites at
build time in the %check section and less than 35% have test suites at all!
There’s definitely room for improvement and I plan to focus on this during 2014!</p>

<p>I've recently started working on this goal by first identifying potential offending
packages and discussing the idea on Fedora's

                    7 Years and 1400 Bugs Later as Red Hat QA
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Today I celebrate my 7th year working at Red Hat's Quality Engineering department.
Here's my story!</p>
<p><img alt="Platform QE" src="/images/redhat_platform_qe.jpg" title="Platform QE" /></p>
<p>On a cold winter Friday in 2007 I left my job as a software developer in Sofia,
packed my stuff together, purchased my <a href="http://amzn.to/1hlPuyr">first laptop</a> and
on Sunday jumped the train to Brno to join the Release Test Team at Red Hat.
Little did I know what it was all about. When I was offered the position
I was on a very noisy bus and had to pick between two positions. I didn't quite understood
what were the options and just picked the second one.
Luckily everything turned out great and continues to this day.</p>
<p>I'm sharing my experience and highlighting some bugs which I've found.
Hopefully you will find this interesting and amusing. If you are a QA engineer
I urge you to take a look at <a href="http://red.ht/1gbHElQ">my public bug portfolio</a>,
dive into details, read the comments and learn as much as you can.</p>
<h2>What do I do exactly</h2>
<p>From all QE teams in Red Hat, Release Test Team is the first one and
last one to test a release. The team has both technical function and a more managerial one.
Our focus is on the core Red Hat Enterprise Linux product. 
Unfortunately I can't go into much details because this is not a public facing unit.
I will limit myself to <strong>public and/or non-sensitive information</strong>.</p>
<p>We are the first to test a new nightly build or a
snapshot of the upcoming RHEL release. If the tree is installable other teams take over
and do their magic. At the end when bits are published live we're the last to
verify that content is published where it is expected to be. In short this is
covering the work of the release engineering team which is to build a product and
publish the contents for consumption.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to Fedora although the engagement here is less demanding.</p>
<p>Personally I have been and continue to be responsible for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
family of releases. It's up to me to give the go ahead for further testing or request
a re-spin. This position
also has the power to block and delay the GA release if not happy with testing or
there is a considerable risk of failure until things are sorted out.</p>
<p>Like in other QA teams I create test plan documents, write test case scenarios,
implement test automation scripts (and sometimes tools), regularly execute said test
plans and test cases, find and report any new bugs and verify old ones are fixed. 
Most importantly make sure RHEL installs and is usable for further testing :).</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to deal with capacity planning and as RHEL 5 installation 
test lead I have to organize and manage the entire installation testing campaign
for that product.</p>
<p>My favorite testing technique is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a>.</p>
<h2>Stats and Numbers</h2>
<p>It is hard (if not impossible) to <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/qe-metrics">measure QA work</a>
with numbers alone but here are some interesting facts about my experience so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 1400 bugs filed (1390 at the time of writing);</li>
<li>Reported bugs across 32 different products. Top 3 being RHEL 6, RHEL 5 and Fedora (1000+ bugs);</li>
<li>Top 3 components for reporting bugs against: anaconda, releng, kernel;</li>
<li>Nearly 100 bugs filed in my first year 2007;</li>
<li>The 3 most productive years being 2010, 2009, 2011 (800 + bugs); </li>
<li>Filed 200 bugs/year which is about 1 bug/day considering holidays;</li>
<li>35th top bug reporter (excluding robot accounts). I was in top 10 a few years back;</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of <a href="http://red.ht/1gbHElQ">the bugs I report</a> are private so if you'd like
to know more stats just ask me and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<h2>2007</h2>
<p>My very first bug is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=231860">RHBZ #231860</a>(private)
which is about the graphical update tool Pup which used to show the wrong number of available
updates.</p>
<p>Then I've played with adding <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/">Dogtail</a> support to Anaconda.
While initially this was rejected (Fedora 6/7), it was <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Features/Dogtail">implemented</a>
few years later (Fedora 9) and then removed once again during the big Anaconda rewrite.</p>
<p>I've spent my time working extensively on RHEL 5 battling with multi-lib issues, SELinux denials and
generally making the 5 family less rough. Because I was still on-boarding I generally worked
on everything I could get my hands on and also did some work on RHEL3-U9 (latest release
before EOL) and some RHEL4-U6 testing.</p>
<p>With ia64 on RHEL3 I found a corner case
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=240782">kernel bug</a> which flooded the serial
console with messages and caused a multi-CPU system to freeze.</p>
<h2>In 2008 Time went backwards</h2>
<p>My first bug in 2008 is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=428280">RHBZ #428280</a>.
glibc introduced SHA-256/512 hashes for hashing passwords with crypt but that wasn't documented.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2014-02-21</strong>
While testing 5.1 to 5.2 updates I found
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=435475">RHBZ #435475</a> - a severe
<strong>performance degradation</strong> in the package installation process. Upgrades
took almost twice as much time to complete, rising <strong>from 4 hours to 7 hours</strong>
depending on hardware and package set. This was a tough one to test and verify.
<strong>END UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>While dogfooding the 5.2 beta in March I hit
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437252">RHBZ #437252</a> - kernel: Timer ISR/0: Time went backwards.
To this date this is one of my favorite bugs with a great error message!</p>
<p>Removal of a hack in RPM led to file conflicts under <code>/usr/share/doc</code> in several packages:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448905">RHBZ #448905</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448906">RHBZ #448906</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448907">RHBZ #448907</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448909">RHBZ #448909</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448910">RHBZ #448910</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448911">RHBZ #448911</a>
which is also the first time I happen to file several bugs in a row.</p>
<p>ia64 couldn't boot with encrypted partitions -
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=464769">RHBZ #464769</a>,
RHEL 5 introduced support for ext4 - <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=465248">RHBZ #465248</a>
and I've hit a fontconfig issue during upgrades - <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=469190">RHBZ #469190</a>
which continued to resurface occasionally during the next 5 years.</p>
<p>This is the year when I took over responsibility for the general installation
testing of RHEL 5 from James Laska and will continue to do so until it reaches end-of-life!</p>
<p>I've also worked on RHEL 4, Fedora and even the OLPC project. On the testing side of things
I've participated in testing
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/TestPlans/Networking">Fedora networking on the XO</a>
hardware and worked on translation and general issues.</p>
<h2>2009 - here comes RHEL 6</h2>
<p>This year starts my 3 most productive years period. </p>
<p>The second bug reported this
year is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481338">RHBZ #481338</a> which
also mentions one of my hobbies - wrist watches. While browsing a particular
website Xorg CPU usage rose to 100%. I've seen a number of these through the years
and I'm still not sure if its Xorg or Firefox or both to blame. And I still see my
CPU usage go to 100% just like that and drain my battery. I'm open to suggestions how
to test and debug what's going on as it doesn't happen in a reproducible fashion.</p>
<p>I happened to work on RHEL 4, RHEL 5, Fedora and the upcoming RHEL 6 releases and
managed to file bugs in a row not once but twice. 
I wish I was paid per bug reported back then :).</p>
<p>The first series was about empty debuginfo packages with both empty packages which
shouldn't have existed at all
(e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500628">redhat-release</a>) 
and missing debuginfo information for binary packages
(e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500612">nmap</a>).</p>
<p>The second series is around 100 bugs which had to do with the texinfo
documentation of packages when installed with --excludedocs. The first one
is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515909">RHBZ #515909</a> and the
last one <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516014">RHBZ #516014</a>.
While this works great for bumping up your bug count it made lots of developers
unhappy and not all bugs were fixed. Still the use case is valid and these
were proper software errors. It is also the first time I've used a script to
file the bugs automatically and not by hand.</p>
<p>Near the end of the year I've started testing installation on new hardware
by the likes of Intel and AMD before they hit the market. I had the pleasure to work
with the latest chipsets and CPUs, even sometime pre-release versions and make sure
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installed and worked properly on them. I've stopped doing
this last year to free up time for other tasks.</p>
<h2>2010 - one bug a day keeps developers at bay :)</h2>
<p>My most productive year with 1+ bugs per day.</p>
<p>2010 starts with a bug about file conflicts (private one) and continues with the same
narrative throughout the year.
As a matter of fact I did a small experiment and found around <strong>50000</strong>
(you read that right, fifty thousand) potentially
conflicting files, mostly between multi-lib packages, which were being ignored by RPM
due to its multi-lib policies. However these were primarily man pages or documentation
and most of them didn't get fixed. The proper fix would have been to introduce a
-docs sub-package and split these files from the actual binaries. Fortunately the world
migrated to 64bit only and this isn't an issue anymore.</p>
<p>By that time RHEL 6 development was running at its peak capacity and there were Beta
versions available. Almost the entire year I've been working on internal RHEL 6 snapshots
and discovering the many new bugs introduced with tons of new features in the installer.
Some of the new features included better IPv6 support, dracut and KVM.</p>
<p>An interesting set of bugs from September are the rpmlint errors and warnings ones,
for example <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=634931">RHBZ #634931</a>. I just
run the most basic test tool against some packages. It generated lots of false negatives
but also revealed bugs which were fixed.</p>
<p>Although there were many bugs filed this year I don't see any particularly interesting ones.
It's been more like lots of work to improve the overall quality than exploring
edge cases and finding interesting failures. If you find a bug from this period that you
think is interesting I will comment on it.</p>
<h2>2011 - Your system may be seriously compromised</h2>
<p>This is the last year of my 3 year top cycle. </p>
<p>It starts with <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=666687">RHBZ #666687</a> -
a patch for my crappy printer-scanner-coffee maker which I've been carrying around
since <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=498228">2009</a> when I bought it.</p>
<p>I was still working primarily on RHEL 6 but helped test the latest RHEL 4 release
before it went end-of-life. The interesting thing about it was that unlike other
released RHEL4-U9 was not available on installation media but only as an update from
RHEL4-U8. This was a great experience which you happen to see
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/errata/">every 4 to 5 years</a> or so.</p>
<p>Btw I've also led the installation testing effort and RTT team through the last few
RHEL 4 releases but given the product was approaching EOL there weren't many changes
and things went smoothly.</p>
<p>A minor side activity was me playing around with
<a href="/blog/2011/03/14/usb-multi-seat-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-6/">USB Multi-seat</a>
and finding a few bugs here and there along the way.</p>
<p>Another interesting activity in 2011 was proof-reading the entire product documentation
before its release which I can now relate to the 
<a href="/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/">Testing Documentation</a>
talk at FOSDEM 2014.</p>
<p>In 2011 I've started using the cloud and most notably Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS service.
First internally as an early adopter and later externally after the product was announced
to the public. There are a few interesting bugs here but they are private and I'm not
at liberty to share although they've all been fixed since then.</p>
<p>An interesting bug with NUMA, Xen and ia64
(<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=696599">RHBZ #696599</a> - private) had
me and devel banging our heads against the wall until we figured out that on this
particular system the NUMA configuration was not suitable for running Xen virtualization.</p>
<p>Can you spot the problem here ?</p>

<p>Be honest and use the comments form to tell me what you've found. If you struggled
then see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703085">RHBZ #703085</a> and come
back again to comment. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p>What do you do when you see an error message saying: 
<strong>Your system may be seriously compromised! /usr/sbin/NetworkManager tried to load a kernel module.</strong>
This is the scariest error message I've ever seen. Luckily its just
SELinux overreacting, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704090">RHBZ #704090</a>.</p>
<h2>2012 is in the red zone</h2>
<p>While the number of reported bugs dropped significantly compared to previous
years this is the year when I've reported almost exclusively high priority and
urgent bugs, the first one being 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=771901">RHBZ #771901</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=799384">RHBZ #799384</a>(against Fedora)
is one of the rare cases when I was able to contribute
(although just by raising awareness) to localization and improved support for
Bulgarian and Cyrillic. 
The other one case was <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/11/fedora-20-gnome-3-dot-10-test-day-post-mortem/">last year</a>.
Btw I find it strange that although 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic was invented by Bulgarians</a>
we didn't (or still don't) have a native font co-maintainer.
Somebody please step up!</p>
<p>The red zone bugs continue to span till the end of the year across RHEL 5, 6 and
early cuts of RHEL 7 with a pinch of OpenShift and some internal and external test tools.</p>
<h2>In 2013 Bugzilla hit 1 million bugs</h2>
<p>The year starts with a very annoying and still not fixed bug against ABRT.
It's very frustrating when the tool which is supposed to help you file bugs
doesn't work properly, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903591">RHBZ #903591</a>.
It's a known fact that
<a href="/2012/07/13/mission-impossible-abrt-bugzilla-plugin-on-rhel6/">ABRT has problems</a>
and for this scenario I may have a 
<a href="/blog/2013/10/12/tip-installing-missing-debuginfo-packages-for-abrt/">tip</a> for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=923416">RHBZ #923416</a> - another one of these
100% CPU bugs. As I said they happen from time to time and mostly go by unfixed or
partially fixed because of their nature. Btw as I'm writing this post and have
a few tabs open in Firefox it keeps using between 15% and 20% CPU and the CPU
temperature is over 90 degrees C. And all I'm doing is writing text in the console.
Help!</p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967229">RHBZ #967229</a> - a minor one but
reveals an important thing - your output (and input for that matter) methods may
be producing different results. Worth testing if your software supports more than one.</p>
<p>This year I did some odd jobs working on several of Red Hat's layered products mainly
Developer Toolset. It wasn't a tough job and was a refreshing break away from the mundane
installation testing.</p>
<p>While I stopped working actively on the various RHEL families which are under development
or still supported I happened to be one of top 10 bug reporters for high/urgent priority bugs
for RHEL 7. In appreciation Red Hat sent me lots of corporate gifts and the Platform QE hoodie
pictured at the top of the page. Many thanks!</p>
<p>In the summer Red Hat's 
<a href="/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-bugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">Bugzilla hit One Million bugs</a>.
The closest I come to this milestone is
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=999941">RHBZ #999941</a>.</p>
<p>I finally managed to transfer most of my responsibilities to co-workers and joined
the Fedora QA team as a part-time contributor. I had some highs and lows with
<a href="/blog/2013/10/07/fedora-20-virtualization-and-gnome-test-days-at-init-lab-this-week/">Fedora test days in Sofia</a>
as well. Good thing is I scored another 15 bugs across the
<a href="/blog/2013/10/08/fedora-20-virtualization-test-day-post-mortem/">virtualization stack</a>
and <a href="/blog/2013/10/11/fedora-20-gnome-3-dot-10-test-day-post-mortem/">GNOME 3.10</a>.</p>
<p>The year wraps up with another series of identical bugs,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1024729">RHBZ #1024729</a> and
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1025289">RHBZ #1025289</a> for example.
As it <a href="/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/">turned out</a>
lots of packages don't have any test suites at all and those
which do don't always execute them automatically in %check. I've promised myself
to improve this but still haven't had time to work on it. Hopefully by
March I will have something in the works.</p>
<h2>2014 - Fedora QA improvement</h2>
<p>Last two months I've been working on some internal projects and looking
a little bit into improving processes, test coverage and QA infrastructure - 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1064895">RHBZ #1064895</a>.
And Rawhide (upcoming Fedora 21) isn't behaving -
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1063245">RHBZ #1063245</a>.</p>
<p>My goal for this year is to do more work on improving the overall test coverage
of Fedora and together with the Fedora QA team bring an
<a href="/blog/2013/11/19/open-source-quality-assurance-infrastructure-for-fedora-qa/">open testing infrastructure</a>
to the community. </p>
<p>Let's see how well that plays out!</p>
<h2>What do I do now</h2>
<p>During the last year I have gradually changed my responsibilities to work more on Fedora.
As a volunteer in the Fedora QA I'm regularly testing installation
of Rawhide trees and try to work closely with the community. I still have to
manage RHEL 5 test cycles where I don't expect nothing disruptive at this stage in the
product life-cycle!</p>
<p>I'm open to any ideas and help which can improve test coverage and quality of software
in Fedora. If you're just joining the open source world this is an excellent
opportunity to do some good, get noticed and even maybe get a job. I will definitely
help you get through the process if you're willing to commit your time to this.</p>
<p>I hope this long post has been useful and fun to read. Please use the comments form to tell
me if I'm missing something or you'd like to know more.</p>
<p><em>Looking forward to the next 7 years!</em></p>

            </p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    FOSDEM 2014 Report - Day #2 Testing and Automation
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="Testing and Automation" src="/images/fosdem/2014/testing_automation.jpg" title="Testing and Automation" /></p>
<p>FOSDEM was hosting the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">Testing and automation devroom</a>
for the second year and this was the very reason I attended the conference. I managed to get in
early and stayed until 15:00 when I had to leave to catch my flight (which was late :(). </p>
<p>There were 3 talks given by Red Hat employees in the testing devroom which was a nice opportunity
to meet some of the folks I've been working on IRC with. Unfortunately I didn't meet anyone from
Fedora QA. Not sure if they were attending or not. </p>
<p>All the talks were interesting so see the official schedule and video for more details. I will
highlight only the items I saw as particularly interesting or have not heard of before. </p>
<h2>ANSTE</h2>
<p>ANSTE - Advanced Network Service Testing Environment is a test infrastructure controller,
something like our own <a href="http://beaker-project.org/">Beaker</a> but designed to create complex
networking environments. I think it lacks many of the provisioning features built in Beaker
and integration with various hypervisors and bare-metal provisioning. What it seems to do better
(as far as I can tell from the talk) is to deploy virtual systems and create more complex network
configuration between them. Not something I will need in the near future but definitely worth
a look at. </p>
<h2>cwrap</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>cwrap is...</p>
<p>a set of tools to create a fully isolated network environment to test client/server components on a single host.
It provides synthetic account information, hostname resolution and support for privilege separation.
The heart of cwrap consists of three libraries you can preload to any executable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one was the coolest technology I've seen so far although I may not need to use it at all,
hmmm maybe testing DHCP fits the case.</p>
<p>It evolved from the Samba project and takes advantage of the order in which
libraries are searched when resolving functions. When you preload the project libraries
to any executable they will override standard libc functions for working with sockets,
user accounts and privilege escalation.</p>
<p>The socket_wrapper library redirects networking sockets through local UNIX sockets and
gives you the ability to test applications which need privileged ports with a local developer
account. </p>
<p>The nss_wrapper library provides artificial information for user and group accounts,
network name resolution using a hosts file and loading and testing of NSS modules.</p>
<p>The uid_wrapper library allows uid switching as a normal user (e.g. fake root) and
supports user/group changing in the local thread using the syscalls (like glibc).</p>
<p>All of these wrapper libraries are controlled via environment variables and definitely
makes testing of daemons and networking applications easier.</p>
<h2>Testing Documentation</h2>
<p>That one was just scratching the surface of an entire branch of testing which I've not
even considered before. The talk also explains why it is hard to test documentation and
what possible solutions there are. </p>
<p>If you write user guides and technical articles which need to
stay current with the software this is definitely the place to start.</p>
<h2>Automation in the Foreman Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The last <a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem//2014/previews/fosdem/fosdem_2014/dv/UD2218A/2014-02-02/12_51_36.ogv">talk</a>
I've listened to. Definitely the best one from a general testing approach
point of view. Greg talked about starting with Foreman unit tests, then testing the merged PR,
then integration tests, then moving on to test the package build and then the resulting packages themselves. </p>
<p>These guys try to even test their own infrastructure (infra as code) and the test suites
they use to test everything else. It's all about automation and the level of confidence
you have in the entire process.</p>
<p>I like the fact that no single testing approach can make you confident enough before shipping
the code and that they've taken into account changes which get introduced at various places
(e.g. 3rd party package upgrades, distro specific issues, infrastructure changes and such) </p>
<p>If I had to attend only one session it would have been this one. There are many things for me
to take back home and apply to my work on Fedora and RHEL.</p>
<p>If you find any of these topics remotely interesting I advise you to wait until FOSDEM video
team uploads the recordings and watch the entire session stream. I'm definitely missing a lot
of stuff which can't be easily reproduced in text form.</p>
<p>You can also find my report of the first FOSDEM'14 day on Saturday
<a href="/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-1-python-stands-lightning-talks/">here</a>.</p>

                    Upstream Test Suite Status of Fedora 20
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Last week I've expressed my thoughts about the state of
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-December/119637.html">upstream test suites in Fedora</a>
along with some other ideas. Following the response on this thread I'm starting
to analyze all SRPM packages in Fedora 20 in order to establish a baseline. Here are my initial findings.</p>
<h2>What's Inside</h2>
<p>I've found two source distributions for Fedora 20:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Fedora-20-source-DVD.iso</code> file which to my knowledge contains the sources
of all packages that comprise the installation media;</li>
<li>The <code>Everything/source/SRPMS/</code> directory which appears to contain the sources
of everything else available in the Fedora 20 repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <strong>2574</strong> SRPM packages in Fedora-20 source DVD and <strong>14364</strong> SRPMs
in the Everything/ directory. 9,2G vs. 41G.</p>
<h2>Test Suite Execution In %check</h2>
<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Test_Suites">Fedora Packaging Guidelines</a>
state</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the source code of the package provides a test suite,
it should be executed in the %check section,
whenever it is practical to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my research I found <strong>738</strong> SRPMs on the DVD which have a %check
section and <strong>4838</strong> such packages under <code>Everything/</code>. This is <strong>28,6%</strong> and <strong>33,6%</strong>
respectively.</p>
<h2>Test Suite Existence</h2>
<p>A quick grep for either <code>test/</code> or <code>tests/</code> directories in the package sources revealed
<strong>870</strong> SRPM packages in the source DVD which are very likely to have a test suite.
This is <strong>33,8%</strong>. <strike>I wasn't able to inspect the <code>Everything/</code> directory with this script
because it takes too long to execute and my system crashed out of memory.
I will update this post later with that info.</strike></p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2014-01-02</em>: 
In the <code>Everything/</code> directory only <strong>4481</strong> (<strong>31,2%</strong>) SRPM packages appear to have
test suites.</p>
<p>The scripts and raw output are available at <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts">https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts</a>.</p>
<p>So it looks like on average <strong>30%</strong> of the packages execute their test suites at build
time in the %check section and less than <strong>35%</strong> have test suites at all!
There's definitely room for improvement and I plan to focus on this during 2014!</p>

                    Can I Use Android Phone as Smart Card Reader
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Today I had troubles with my Omnikey CardMan 6121 smart card reader.
For some reason it will not detect the card inside and was unusable.
<code>/var/log/messages</code> was filled with  <em>Card Not Powered</em> messages:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Dec 18 11:17:55 localhost pcscd: eventhandler.c:292:EHStatusHandlerThread() Error powering up card: -2146435050 0x80100016
Dec 18 11:18:01 localhost pcscd: winscard.c:368:SCardConnect() Card Not Powered
Dec 18 11:18:02 localhost pcscd: winscard.c:368:SCardConnect() Card Not Powered
</pre></div>


<p><img src="/images/omnikey_cardman_6121.gif" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;" /></p>
<p>I've found the solution in 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531998">RHBZ #531998</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've found the problem, and it's purely mechanical.
Omnikey has simply screwed up when they designed this reader.
When the reader is inserted into the ExpressCard slot, it gets slightly
compressed. This is enough to trigger the mechanical switch that detects
insertions. If I jam something in there and force it apart, then pcscd
starts reporting that the slot is empty.</p>
<p>Pierre Ossman, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531998#c12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I tried moving the smart card a millimeter back and forth inside the reader and
that fixed it for me.</p>
<p>This smart card is standard SIM size and I wonder if it is possible to use
<a href="http://amzn.to/1dnl2gN">dual SIM</a> smart phones and <a href="http://amzn.to/18XpWlp">tablets</a>
as a reader? I will be happy to work on the software side if there is an open source
project already (e.g. OpenSC + drivers for Android). If not, why not? </p>
<p>If you happen to have information on the subject please share it in the comments.
Thanks!</p>

<p>The code above works fine with curl-7.27 or older while it breaks with curl-7.29 and
newer. As explained by 
<a href="http://lists.baseurl.org/pipermail/yum-devel/2013-November/010428.html">Zdenek Pavlas</a>
the reason is an internal change in libcurl which doesn't accept a value of 1 anymore!</p>
<p>The bug is reproducible with a newer libcurl version and a vanilla urlgrabber==3.9.1
from PyPI (e.g. inside a virtualenv). The latest python-urlgrabber RPM packages in both
Fedora and Amazon Linux already have the fix.</p>
<p>I have tested the patch proposed by Zdenek and it works for me. I still have no idea why
there aren't any updates released on PyPI though!</p>

                <p><img alt="&quot;Beaker test lab&quot;" src="/images/fedora/beaker.png" title="Beaker test lab" /></p>
<p>In the last few weeks I've been working together with 
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tflink">Tim Flink</a> and
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kparal">Kamil Paral</a> from the Fedora QA
team on bringing some installation testing expertise to Fedora and establishing
an <a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/">open source test lab</a>
to perform automated testing in. The infrastructure is
already in relatively usable condition so I've decided to share this information
with the community. </p>
<h2>Beaker is Running Our Test Lab</h2>
<p><a href="http://beaker-project.org/">Beaker</a> is the software suite that powers the test
lab infrastructure. It is quite complex, with many components and sometimes not
very straight-forward to set up. Tim has been working on that with me giving it
a try and reporting issues as they have been discovered and fixed. </p>
<p>In the process of working on this I've managed to create
<a href="http://gerrit.beaker-project.org/#/q/owner:%22Alexander+Todorov%22,n,z">couple of patches</a>
against Beaker and friends. They are still pending release in a future version
because of more urgent bug fixes which need to released first.</p>
<h2>SNAKE is The Kickstart Template Server</h2>
<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> is a client/server Python framework used
to support Anaconda installations. It supports plain text ks.cfg files, IIRC those
were static templates, no variable substitution.</p>
<p>The other possibility is Python templates based on Pykickstart:</p>

<p>At the moment SNAKE is essentially abandoned but feature complete.
I'm thinking about adopting the project just in case we need to make some fixes.
Will let you know more about this when it happens. </p>
<h2>Open Source Test Suite</h2>
<p>I have been working on opening up several test cases for what we (QE) call
a tier #1 installation test suite. They can be found in
<a href="http://taskbot.cloud.fedoraproject.org/cgit/fedora-beaker-tests/">git</a>.
The tests are base on <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/beakerlib/">beakerlib</a> and
the legacy RHTS framework which is now part of Beaker.</p>
<p>This effort has been coordinated with Kamil as part of a pilot
project he's responsible for. I've been executing the same test suite against
earlier Fedora 20 snapshots but using an internal environment. Now everything
is going out in the open.</p>
<h2>Executing The Tests</h2>
<p>Well you can't do that - YET! There are command line client tools for Fedora
but Beaker and SNAKE are not well suited for use outside a restricted network
like LAN or VPN. There are issues with authentication most notably for SNAKE.</p>
<p>At the moment I have to ssh through two different systems to get proper access.
However this is been worked on. I've read about a rewrite which will allow Beaker
to utilize a custom authentication framework like FAS for example. Hopefully that
will be implemented soon enough.</p>
<p>I will also like to see the test systems have direct access to the Internet for
various reasons but this is not without its risks either. This is still to be
decided.</p>
<p>If you are interested anyway see the <code>kick-tests.sh</code> file in the test suite for
examples and command line options.</p>
<h2>Test Results</h2>
<p>The first successfully completed
<a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/jobs/">test jobs</a> are jobs 50 to 58.
There's a failure in one of the test cases, namely SELinux related 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1027148">RHBZ #1027148</a>.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the lab is now working as expected and we can start doing
some testing against Fedora development snapshots.</p>

                    Keeping Backwards Compatibility for pykickstart
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm using <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> templates as part of my
installation testing work;</li>
<li>SNAKE has a dependency on pykickstart;</li>
<li>To test the latest and greatest kickstart features in Fedora we need the
latest version of pykickstart;</li>
<li>Latest pykickstart needs Python 2.7</li>
<li>Python 2.7 is not available on RHEL 6 which is used to host the test
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just yesterday I hit an issue with the above setup and figured Fedora QA is
in a kind of strange situation - we always need the latest but need it
conservative enough to run on RHEL 6. See the original thread at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/kickstart-list/2013-November/msg00001.html">kickstart-list</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular case the solution will be to remove the offending code
and implement the same functionality in backward-compatible manner. Also add
more tests. I will be working on this tomorrow (there's an older patch already).</p>
<p>The BIG question remains though - how do you manage software evolution and still
keep it compatible with older execution stacks? Please share your experience in
the comments section.</p>
<hr />
<p>PP: Spoiler - this is part of an ongoing effort to bring open source installation
testing expertise (my domain) into Fedora world, plus establish a community supported
test infrastructure. More info TBA soon.</p>

<p>Here is my summary of the second Fedora Test Day hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Local attendance was a total disaster, in fact I was testing once again by my own.
This time
there were more people in the lab, all busy with their daily routines and tasks.
There were no people who came for the testing :(. I will have to try different
venues in the future and see if the situation improves.</p>
<p>On the testing front I managed to score 5 bugs against
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=709797,709799,709806,709810">GNOME</a>
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017807">Fedora</a>.
You can see the other test results and bugs on the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-10_Gnome_3.10">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>There are two things I didn't like in particular</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 as well as its classic mode - simply not the environment I'm used to;</li>
<li>Having to record test results in the wiki! I'm
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-October/118284.html">writing</a>
to the Fedora QA mailing list about that as we speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>At one time I was engaged in a discussion about which Bulgarian keyboard layout
should be the default in GNOME simply because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709799">GNOME #709799</a>. The default
keyboard layout will be Bulgarian (traditional phonetic) aka bg+phonetic.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>(16,13,26) rtcm: atodorov: are you bulgarian and/or live in bulgaria?
(16,14,20) rtcm: atodorov: if yes, I wanted to know which keyboard layout most people expect there to be the default
(16,16,34) atodorov: rtcm: I&#39;m a Bulgarian, however I can&#39;t tell which one. Both Phonetic and standard (BDS) are common
(16,16,54) atodorov: a safe bet is to go with phonetic I guess. 
(16,19,46) rtcm: atodorov: can you tell me which one is it in XKB terms? is it &quot;bg&quot;, &quot;bg+bas_phonetic&quot; or &quot;bg+phonetic&quot; ?
(16,20,51) rtcm: they&#39;re labeled as &quot;Bulgarian&quot;, &quot;Bulgarian (new phonetic)&quot; and &quot;Bulgarian (traditional phonetic)&quot;
(16,21,30) atodorov: bg+phonetic is the traditional phonetic
(16,22,04) atodorov: bg labeled as &quot;Bulgarian&quot; is the standard one I guess. Here we call it BDS after the standardization institute
(16,22,34) atodorov: bg+bas_phonetic is created from the Bulgarian Academy of Science and is not very popular as far as I know. I&#39;ve never seen it in use
(16,23,15) rtcm: atodorov: all I want to know is what most people would expect? like what does windows do by default? that&#39;s a good bet
(16,27,46) atodorov: rtcm: I&#39;m just being told that new Windows releases use yet another layout by default, which is like phonetic but with some characters in new places and people don&#39;t like that
(16,27,53) atodorov: my safe bet goes to bg+phonetic
(16,29,05) rtcm: ok, thanks

<p>It is a rare occasion when you get to make a decision that affects a large group
of people and I hope you don't hate me for that! </p>

organize some more!</p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of the first Fedora Test Day in Sofia I hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> today.</p>
<p>Attendance was quite poor, actually nobody else except me participated but
almost nobody else visited the hackespace as well. I get that it is a
working day and Test Days conflict with regular business hours but this
is not going to change anyway. On the other hand where were all the freelancers
and non-office job workers who usually hang around in the Lab? I have no idea!</p>
<p>On IRC there was much better activity, 5 or 6 people were testing across
Asia, Europe and USA time zones. You can see the test results
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">here</a>.
I've started filing quite a few bugs in the morning and continued well into the
afternoon. I've managed to file a total of
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1016435,1016449,1016488,1016530,1016604,1016613,1016648,1016663,1016704,1016715">10 bugs</a>.
Some of them were not related to virtualization and some of them turned out to be
duplicates or not a bug. I even managed to file 2 duplicate bugs which likely have the
same root cause myself :). </p>
<p>I've also experienced two bugs filed by other people:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967371">RHBZ #967371</a> for MATE desktop
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1015636">RHBZ #1015636</a> for
virt-manager's Save/Restore functionality.</p>
<p>I've tried ARM on x86_64 but that didn't get anywhere near a running system.
I will make another post about ARM and what I've discovered there.</p>
<p>The one thing I liked is the 
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">test results application</a>.
It is not what I'm used to when dealing with RHEL, has far less features but is
very fast and easy to use and suits the Test Days participants just fine.
And is definitely much easier to use compared to filing results in the wiki.</p>
<p>Overall Fedora 20 virtualization status according to me is pretty good.</p>
<p>I hope to see more attendance <a href="http://initlab.org/event/gnome-test-day">on Thursday</a>
when we're going to test GNOME 3.10.</p>
