<p>There's a typo in the Bulgarian translation of Messenger.com.
It is highlighted by the red dot on the picture.</p>
<p><em>hunspell</em> easily catches it so either Facebook doesn't run their
translations through a spell checker or their spell checker is
borked.</p>

                <p>Do you remember the 
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/pedometer-bug-in-samsung-gear-fit-smartwatch/">pedometer bug in Samsung Gear Fit</a>
I've discovered earlier ? It turns out that Samsung is a fan of this one
and has the exact same bug in their <em>S Health</em> application.</p>
<p>The application doesn't block pedometer(e.g. steps counting) while
performing other activities such as cycling for example. So in reallity it
reports incorrect value for burned callories. At this time I call it
bad software development practice/architecture on Samsung's part which leads
to this bug being present.</p>

                    Call for Ideas: Graphical Test Coverage Reports
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>
<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>
<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>
<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format, 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a 
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>
<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>
<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>
<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

and while the hardware seems good I'm a bit disapointed on the software side.
There is at least one bug which is clearly visible - <strong>pedometer counts calories twice
when it's on and exercise mode is started</strong>.</p>
<p>How to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the <em>Pedometer</em> app and record any initial readings;</li>
<li>Walk a fixed distance and at the end record all readings;</li>
<li>Now go back to the <em>Exercise</em> app and select a <em>Walking</em>
exercise from the menu. Tap <em>Start</em>;</li>
<li>Walk back the same distance/road as before. At the end of the journey
stop the walking exercise and record all readings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected results:</p>
<p>At the end of the trip I expect to see roughly the same calories burned
for both directions.</p>
<p>Actual results:</p>
<p>The return trip counted twice as many calories compared to the forward trip.
Here's some actual data to prove it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>+--------------------------+----------+----------------+---------+-------------+---------+

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Data values above were taken from Samsung's <em>S Health</em> app which is easier to work with
instead of the Gear Fit itself.</p>
<p>The problem is that both apps are accessing the sensor simultaneously and not aware of each other.
In theory it should be relatively easy to block access of one app while the other is running but
that may not be so easy to implement on the limited platform the Gear Fit is.</p>

                    2 Barcode Related Bugs in MyFitnessPal
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="Barcode that fails to scan" src="/images/barcode/fail.jpg" title="Barcode that fails to scan" /></p>
<p><strong>Did you know that the popular <em>MyFitnessPal</em> application can't scan barcodes
printed on curved surfaces?</strong> The above barcode fails to scan because it is
printed on a metal can full of roasted almonds :). In contrast the
<em>Barcode Scanner</em> from <em>ZXing Team</em> understands it just fine. My bet is
<em>MyFitnessPal</em> uses less advanced barcode scanning library. Judging from
the visual clues in the app the issue is between 6 and 0 where white space is wider.</p>
<p><img alt="Barcode that scans fine" src="/images/barcode/pass.jpg" title="Barcode that scans fine" /></p>
<p>Despite being a bit blurry this second barcode is printed on a flat surface and
is understood by both <em>MyFitnessPal</em> and "ZXing Barcode Scanner".</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> I get the same results regardless if I try to scan the actual barcode
printed on packaging, a picture from a mobile device screen or these two images
from the laptop screen.</p>
<p><strong>MyFitnessPal also has problems with duplicate barcodes!</strong> Barcodes are not unique
and many producers use the same code for multiple products. I've seen this in the
case of two different varieties of salami from the same manufacturer on the good end
and two different products produced across the world (eggs and popcorn) on the
extreme end.</p>
<p>Once the user scans their barcodes and establish that the existing information is
not correct they can <em>Create a Food</em> and update the calories database. This is then
synced back to MyFitnesPal servers and overrides any existing information. When the same
barcode is scanned for the second time only the new DB entry is visible.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan an existing barcode and enter it to MFP database if not already there;</li>
<li>Scan the same barcode one more time and pretend the information is not correct;</li>
<li>Click the <em>Create a Food</em> button and fill-in the fields. For example use a
different food name to distinguish between the two database entries. Save!</li>
<li>From another device with different account (to verify information in DB)
scan the same barcode again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actual results:
The last entered information is shown.</p>
<p>Expected results:
User is shown both DB records and can select between them.</p>

            </a>
                <p>Happy new year everyone. During the holidays I've discovered several interesting
bugs which will be revealed in this blog. Starting today with a bug in the popular
game <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>.</p>
<p>In level 80 one teleport is still open but the chocolates are blocking the rest.
The game has ended but candies keep flowing through the teleport and the level doesn't exit.
My guess is that the game logic is missing a check whether or not it will go into an endless loop.</p>

<p>This bug seems to be generic for the entire game. It pops up also on
level 137 in the Owl part of the game (recorded by somebody else):</p>

                    BlackBerry Z10 is Killing My WiFi Router
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Few days ago I've resurrected my BlackBerry Z10 only to find out that it kills
my WiFi router shortly after connecting to the network.
It looks like many people are having the same problem with BlackBerry but most forum
threads don't offer a meaningful solution so I did some tests. </p>
<p>Everything works fine when WiFi mode is set to either 11bgn mixed or 11n only and
WiFi security is disabled.</p>
<p>When using WPA2/Personal security mode and AES encryption the problem occurs
regardless of which WiFi mode is used. There is another type of encryption called TKIP
but the device itself warns that this is not supported by the 802.11n specification
(all my devices use it anyway).</p>
<p>So to recap:
<strong>BlackBerry Z10 causes my TP-Link router to die if using WPA2/Personal security with
AES Encryption. Switching to open network with MAC address filtering works fine!</strong></p>
<p>I haven't had the time to upgrade the firmware of this router and see if the problem persists.
Most likely I'll just go ahead and flash it with OpenWRT.</p>

                    Speed Comparison of Web Proxies Written in Python Twisted and Go
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>After I figured out that
<a href="/blog/2014/11/11/speeding-up-celery-backends-part-3/">Celery is rather slow</a>
I moved on to test another part of my environment - a web proxy server.
The test here compares two proxy 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/666035d270d97d982cd5">implementations</a>
- one with Python Twisted,
the other in Go. The backend is a simple web server written in Go, which is
probably the fastest thing when it comes to serving HTML.</p>
<p>The test content is a snapshot of the front page of this blog taken few days ago.
The system is a standard Lenovo X220 laptop, with Intel Core i7 CPU, with 4 cores.
The measurement instrument is the popular wrk tool with a
<a href="/blog/2014/11/18/proxy-support-for-wrk-http-benchmarking-tool/">custom Lua script to redirect the requests through the proxy</a>.</p>
<p>All tests were repeated several times, only the best results are shown here.
I've taken time between the tests in order for all open TCP ports to close.
I've also observed the number of open ports (e.g. sockets) using <code>netstat</code>.</p>
<h2>Baseline</h2>
<p>Using wrk against the web server in Go yields around 30000 requests per second
with an average of 2000 TCP ports in use:</p>

<h2>Python Twisted</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/666035d270d97d982cd5">Twisted implementation</a>
performs at little over 1000 reqs/sec with an average TCP port use between 20000 and 30000:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./wrk -c1000 -t20 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080 -s scripts/proxy.lua -- http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html

</pre></div>


<h2>Go proxy</h2>
<p>First I've run several 30 seconds tests and performance was around 8000 req/sec
with around 20000 ports used (most of them remain in TIME_WAIT state for a while).
Then I've modified <code>proxy.go</code> to make use of all available CPUs on the system and let
the test run for 5 minutes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>./wrk -c1000 -t20 -d300s http://127.0.0.1:9090 -s scripts/proxy.lua -- http://127.0.0.1:8000/atodorov.html

    Latency   137.22ms  437.95ms   4.45s    97.55%
    Req/Sec   669.54    198.52     1.71k    76.40%

  Non-2xx or 3xx responses: 2870522
Requests/sec:  11404.19
Transfer/sec:    198.78MB
</pre></div>


<p>Performance peaked at 10000 req/sec. TCP port usage initially rose to around 30000
but rapidly dropped and stayed around 3000. Both <code>webserver.go</code> and <code>proxy.go</code> were
printing the following messages on the console:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">2014</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">11</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nt">18</span> <span class="nt">21</span><span class="nd">:53:06</span> <span class="nt">http</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">Accept</span> <span class="nt">error</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">accept</span> <span class="nt">tcp</span> <span class="cp">[</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="cp">]</span><span class="nd">:9090</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">too</span> <span class="nt">many</span> <span class="nt">open</span> <span class="nt">files</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="nt">retrying</span> <span class="nt">in</span> <span class="nt">1s</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There's no doubt that Go is blazingly fast compared to Python and I'm most likely to use it
further in my experiments. Still I didn't expect a 3x difference in performance from webserver vs. proxy.</p>
<p>Another thing that worries me is the huge number of open TCP ports which then drops and stays
consistent over time and the error messages from both webserver and proxy (maybe per process sockets limit).</p>
<p>At the moment I'm not aware of the internal workings of neither wrk, nor
Go itself, nor the goproxy library to make conclusion if this is a bad thing or expected.
I'm eager to hear what others think in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<h2>Update 2015-01-27</h2>
<p>I have retested with PyPy but on a different system so I'm giving all the test results
on it as well. <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> says we have 16 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2450L 0 @ 1.80GHz
CPUs. </p>

<p>As seen Go proxy is slower than the Go server by factor of 2.
Python proxy is slower by than the Go server by factor of 20.
These results are similar to previous ones so I don't think PyPy
makes any significant difference.</p>

                    Proxy Support for wrk HTTP Benchmarking Tool
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Few times recently I've seen people using an HTTP benchmarking tool called
<a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> and decided to give it a try. It is a very cool
instrument but didn't fit my use case perfectly. What I needed is to be able to
redirect the connection through a web proxy and measure how much the proxy
slows down things compared to hitting the web server directly with wrk.
In other words - how fast is the proxy server.</p>
<h2>How does a proxy work</h2>
<p>I've examined the source code of two proxies (one in Python and another one in Go)
and what happens is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proxy server starts listening to a TCP port</li>
<li>A client (e.g. the browser) sends the request using an absolute URL (GET http://example.com/about.html)</li>
<li>Instead of connecting directly to the web server behind example.com the client connects to the proxy</li>
<li>The proxy server does connect to example.com directly, reads the response and delivers it back to 
the client.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proxy in wrk</h2>
<p>Luckily wrk supports the execution of Lua scripts so we can make a 
<a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk/pull/107">simple script</a> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">init</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nx">target_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">args</span><span class="cp">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="cp">]</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="nx">proxy</span> <span class="nx">needs</span> <span class="nx">absolute</span> <span class="nx">URL</span>
<span class="nx">end</span>

<span class="nx">request</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">wrk</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">target_url</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nx">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then update your command line to something like this:
    ./wrk [options] http://proxy:port -s proxy.lua -- http://example.com/about.html</p>
<p>This causes wrk to connect to our proxy server but instead issue GET requests for another URL.
Depending on how your proxy works you may need to add the <code>Host: example.com</code> header as well.
Now let's do some testing.</p>

                    Speeding Up Celery Backends, Part 3
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In the second part of this article we've seen 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/07/speeding-up-celery-backends-part-2/">how slow Celery actually is</a>.
Now let's explore what happens inside and see if we can't speed things up.</p>
<p>I've used <a href="http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/latest/">pycallgraph</a> to create
call graph visualizations of my application. It has the nice feature to also show
execution time and use different colors for fast and slow operations.</p>
<p>Full command line is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pycallgraph -v --stdlib --include ... graphviz -o calls.png -- ./manage.py celery_load_test
</pre></div>


<p>where the <code>--include</code> is used to limit the graph to a particular Python module(s).</p>
<h2>General findings</h2>
<p><img alt="call graph" src="/images/celery/general.png" title="call graph" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The first four calls is where most of the time is spent as seen on the picture. </li>
<li>As it seems most of the slow down comes from Celery itself, not the underlying messaging
transport Kombu (not shown on picture)</li>
<li><code>celery.app.amqp.TaskProducer.publish_task</code> takes half of the execution time of
<code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code></li>
<li><code>celery.app.task.Task.delay</code> directly executes <code>.apply_async</code> and can be skipped if one
rewrites the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More findings</h2>
<p>In <code>celery.app.base.Celery.send_task</code> there is this block of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>349         with self.producer_or_acquire(producer) as P:
350             self.backend.on_task_call(P, task_id)
351             task_id = P.publish_task(
352                 name, args, kwargs, countdown=countdown, eta=eta,
353                 task_id=task_id, expires=expires,
354                 callbacks=maybe_list(link), errbacks=maybe_list(link_error),
355                 reply_to=reply_to or self.oid, **options
356             )
</pre></div>


<p><code>producer</code> is always None because delay() doesn't pass it as argument.
I've tried passing it explicitly to apply_async() as so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">djapp.celery</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

<span class="c"># app = debug_task._get_app() # if not defined in djapp.celery</span>
<span class="n">producer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">amqp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">producer_pool</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">acquire</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">debug_task</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apply_async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">producer</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">producer</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However this doesn't speedup anything. If we replace the above code block like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>349         with producer as P:
</pre></div>


<p>it blows up on the second iteration because producer and its channel is already None !?!</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the with statement in Python please read
<a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm">this article</a>. In short the with statement is
a compact way of writing try/finally. The underlying <code>kombu.messaging.Producer</code> class does a
<code>self.release()</code> on exit of the with statement.</p>
<p>I also tried killing the with statement and using producer directly but with limited success. While
it was not released(was non None) on subsequent iterations the memory usage grew much more and there
wasn't any performance boost.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The with statement is used throughout both Celery and Kombu and I'm not at all sure if
there's a mechanism for keep-alive connections. My time constraints are limited and I'll probably
not spend anymore time on this problem soon.</p>
<p>Since my use case involves task producer and consumers on localhost I'll try to workaround the
current limitations by using Kombu directly 
(see <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">this gist</a>) with a transport that
uses either a UNIX domain socket or a name pipe (FIFO) file.</p>

                    Speeding up Celery Backends, Part 2
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In the <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">first part</a> of this
post I looked at a few celery backends and discovered they didn't meet my needs.
Why is the Celery stack slow? How slow is it actually?</p>
<h2>How slow is Celery in practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Queue: 500`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Kombu:  14`000 msg/sec</li>
<li>Celery:  2`000 msg/sec</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed test description</h2>
<p>There are three main components of the Celery stack: </p>
<ul>
<li>Celery itself</li>
<li>Kombu which handles the transport layer</li>
<li>Python Queue()'s underlying everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/2bc1fcd34531ad260ed7">Queue and Kombu tests</a>
run for 1 000 000 messages I got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw Python Queue: Msgs per sec: 500`000</li>
<li>Raw Kombu without Celery where <code>kombu/utils/__init__.py:uuid()</code> is set to return 0<ul>
<li>with json serializer: Msgs per sec: 5`988</li>
<li>with pickle serializer: Msgs per sec: 12`820</li>
<li>with the custom mem_serializer from <a href="/blog/2014/11/05/speeding-up-celery-backends/">part 1</a>:
Msgs per sec: 14`492</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> when the test is executed with 100K messages mem_serializer yielded
25`000 msg/sec then the performance is saturated. I've observed similar behavior 
with raw Python Queue()'s. I saw some cache buffers being managed internally to avoid OOM
exceptions. This is probably the main reason performance becomes saturated over a longer
execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a> modified to
loop 1 000 000 times I got 1908.0 tasks created per sec.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting this worth outlining - in the kombu test there are these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>with producers[connection].acquire(block=True) as producer:
    for j in range(1000000):
</pre></div>


<p>If we swap them the performance drops down to 3875 msg/sec which is comparable with the
Celery results. Indeed inside Celery there's the same <code>with producer.acquire(block=True)</code>
construct which is executed every time a new task is published. Next I will be looking 
into this to figure out exactly where the slowliness comes from.</p>

                    Speeding up Celery Backends, Part 1
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I'm working on an application which fires a lot of Celery tasks - the more
the better! Unfortunately Celery backends seem to be rather slow :(.
Using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/atodorov/0156cc41491a5e1ff953">celery_load_test.py</a>
command for Django I was able to capture some metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon SQS backend: 2 or 3 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Filesystem backend: 2000 - 2500 tasks/sec</li>
<li>Memory backend: around 3000 tasks/sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad but I need in the order of 10000 tasks created per sec!
The other noticeable thing is that memory backend isn't much faster compared to
the filesystem one! NB: all of these backends actually come from the kombu package.</p>
<h2>Why is Celery slow ?</h2>
<p>Using <code>celery_load_test.py</code> together with 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/05/performance-profiling-in-python-with-cprofile/">cProfile</a> I
was able to pin-point some problematic areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>kombu/transports/virtual/__init__.py</code>: class Channel.basic_publish() - does
self.encode_body() into base64 encoded string. Fixed with custom transport backend
I called fastmemory which redefines the body_encoding property:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@cached_property</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">body_encoding</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Celery uses json or pickle (or other) serializers to serialize the data.
While json yields between 2000-3000 tasks/sec, pickle does around 3500 tasks/sec.
Replacing with a custom serializer which just returns
the objects (since we read/write from/to memory) yields about 4000 tasks/sec tops:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">kombu.serialization</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">register</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">loads</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">s</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dumps</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">s</span>

<span class="n">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;mem_serializer&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dumps</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">loads</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">content_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;application/x-memory&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">content_encoding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;binary&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p><code>kombu/utils/__init__.py</code>: def uuid() - generates random unique identifiers
which is a slow operation. Replacing it with <code>return "00000000"</code> boosts performance
to 7000 tasks/sec.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that a constant UUID is not of any practical use but serves well to illustrate
how much does this function affect performance. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Subsequent executions of <code>celery_load_test</code> seem to report degraded performance even with
the most optimized transport backend. I'm not sure why is this. One possibility is the random
UUID usage in other parts of the Celery/Kombu stack which drains entropy on the system and
generating more random numbers becomes slower. If you know better please tell me!</p>
<p>I will be looking for a better understanding
of these IDs in Celery and hope to be able to produce a faster uuid() function. Then I'll be
exploring the transport stack even more in order to reach the goal of 10000 tasks/sec.
If you have any suggestions or pointers please share them in the comments.</p>

                    SNAKE is no Longer Needed to Run Installation Tests in Beaker
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>This is a quick status update for one of the pieces of
<a href="/blog/2013/11/19/open-source-quality-assurance-infrastructure-for-fedora-qa/">Fedora QA infrastructure</a>
and mostly a self-note.</p>
<p>Previously to control the kickstart configuration used during installation in Beaker one
had to either modify the job XML in Beaker or use SNAKE (<code>bkr workflow-snake</code>) to render
a kickstart configuration from a Python template.</p>
<p>SNAKE presented challenges when deploying and using
<a href="https://beaker.fedoraproject.org">beaker.fedoraproject.org</a> and is
virtually unmaintained.</p>
<p>I present the new <code>bkr workflow-installer-test</code> which uses Jinja2 templates to
generate a kickstart configuration when provisioning the system. This is already
available in beaker-client-0.17.1.</p>
<p>The templates make use of all Jinja2 features (as far as I can tell) so you can create
very complex ones. You can even include snippets from one template into another if required.
The standard context that is passed to the template is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISTRO</strong> - if specified, the distro name</li>
<li><strong>FAMILY</strong> - as returned by Beaker server, e.g. <em>RedHatEnterpriseLinux6</em></li>
<li><strong>OS_MAJOR</strong> and <strong>OS_MINOR</strong> - also taken from Beaker server. e.g. OS_MAJOR=6 and OS_MINOR=5 for RHEL 6.5</li>
<li><strong>VARIANT</strong> - if specified</li>
<li><strong>ARCH</strong> - CPU architecture like x86_64</li>
<li>any parameters passed to the test job with <code>--taskparam</code>. They are processed last and can override previous values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation related tests at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fedoraqa/fedora-beaker-tests">fedora-beaker-tests</a>
have been updated with a <code>ks.cfg.tmpl</code> templates to use with this new workflow.</p>
<p>This workflow also has the ability to return boot arguments for the installer if needed. 
If any, they should be defined in a <code>{% block kernel_options %}{% endblock %}</code>
block inside the template. A simpler variant is to define a comment line that stars with
<em>## kernel_options:</em></p>
<p>There are still a few issues which need to be fixed before beaker.fedoraproject.org
can be used by the general public though. I will be writing another post about that
so stay tuned.</p>

                <p>Recently I wrote about <a href="/blog/2014/03/04/how-do-you-test-fonts/">testing fonts</a>.
I finally managed to get an answer from the authors of <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your approach for testing Fonts-TLWG?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not automated test. What it does is generate PDF with sample
texts at several sizes (the waterfall), pangrams, and glyph table.
It needs human eyes to investigate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of problems is your test suite designed for ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaping</li>
<li>Glyph coverage</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>We also make use of fontforge features to make spotting errors
easier, such as
- Show extremas
- Show almost vertical/horizontal lines/curves</p>

(through its hb-shape command line tool) to check that the fonts always
output the expected sequence of glyphs, sometimes with the expected
positioning as well. Amiri is a complex font that have many glyph
substitution and positioning rules, so the test suite is designed to
make sure those rules are always executed correctly to catch regressions
in the font (or in HarfBuzz, which sometimes happens since the things I
do in my fonts are not always that common).</p>
<p>I think Lohit project do similar testing for their fonts, and HarfBuzz
itself has a similar test suite with a bunch of nice scripts (though
they are not installed when building HarfBuzz, yet[1]).</p>
<p>Recently I added more kinds of tests, namely checking that OTS[2]
sanitizes the fonts successfully as this is important for using them on
the web, and a test for a common mistakes I made in my feature files
that result in unexpected blank glyphs in the fonts.</p>

<p>The answer is complicated.  I'll do what I can to answer.</p>
<p>First, the FontForge application has a "verification" function which
can be run from a script, and which identifies numerous technical
problems.</p>
<p>FontForge also has a "Find Problems" function that I run by hand.</p>
<p>The monospaced face has special restrictions, first that all glyphs of
non-zero width must be of the same width, and second, that all glyphs
lie within the vertical bounds of the font.</p>
<p>Beside this, I have several other scripts that check for a few things
that FontForge doesn't (duplicate names, that glyph slots agree with
Unicode code within Unicode character blocks).</p>
<p>Several tests scripts have yet to be uploaded to the version control
system -- because I'm unsure of them.</p>
<p>There is a more complicated check of TrueType tables, which attempts
to find cases of tables that have been "shadowed" by the
script/language specification of another table.  This is helpful, but
works imperfectly.</p>
<p>ALL THAT SAID,</p>
<p>In the end, every script used in the font has to be visually checked.
This process takes me weeks, and there's nothing systematic about it,
except that I look at printout of documents in each language to see if
things have gone awry.</p>
<p>For a few documents in a few languages, I have images of how text
<em>should</em> look, and can compare that visually (especially important for
complex scripts.)</p>
<p>A few years back, somebody wrote a clever script that generated images
of text and compared them pixel-by-pixel.  This was a great idea, and
I wish I could use it more effectively, but the problem was that it
was much too sensitive.  A small change to the font (e.g. PostScript
parameters) would cause a small but global change in the rendering.
Also the rendering could vary from one version of the rendering
software to another.  So I don't use this anymore.</p>
<p>That's all I can think of right now.</p>
<p>In fact, testing has been a big problem in getting releases out.  In
the past, each release has taken at least two weeks to test, and then
another week to fix and bundle...if I was lucky.  And for the past
couple of years, I just haven't been able to justify the time
expenditure.  (Besides this, there are still a few serious problems
with the fonts--once again, a matter of time.)</p>
<p>Have a look at the bugs pages, to get an idea of work being done.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if ImageMagic or PIL can help solve the rendering and compare
problem Steve is talking about. They can definitely be used for
<a href="/blog/2013/05/17/linux-and-python-tools-to-compare-images/">image comparison</a>
so maybe coupled with some rendering library it's worth a quick try.</p>

                    Last Week in Fedora QA
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Here are some highlights from the past week discussions in Fedora which I found
interesting or participated in.</p>
<h2>Call to Action: Improving Overall Test Coverage in Fedora</h2>
<p>I can not stress enough how important it is to further
<a href="/blog/2014/02/28/action-improving-test-coverage-in-fedora/">improve test coverage in Fedora</a>!
You can help too. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join upstream and create a test suite for a package you find interesting;</li>
<li>Provide patches - <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-February/196035.html">first patch</a>
came in less than 30 minutes of initial announcement :);</li>
<li>Review packages in the wiki and help identify false negatives;</li>
<li>Forward to people who may be interested to work on these items;</li>
<li>Share and promote in your local open source and developer communities;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Auto BuildRequires</h2>
<p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/auto-buildrequires/">Auto-BuildRequires</a>
is a simple set of scripts which compliments <code>rpmbuild</code> by
automatically suggesting BuildRequires lines for the just built package.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have this integrated into Koji and/or
continuous integration environment and compare the output between every two
consecutive builds (iow older and newer package versions). It sounds like a
good way to identify newly added or removed dependencies and update the package
specs accordingly.</p>
<h2>How To Test Fonts Packages</h2>
<p>This is exactly what 
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-February/120570.html">Christopher Meng asked</a>
and frankly I have no idea. </p>
<p>I've come across a few fonts packages (<em>amiri-fonts</em>, <em>gnu-free-fonts</em> and <em>thai-scalable-fonts</em>)
which seem to have some sort of test suites but I don't know how they work or
what type of problems they test for. On top of that all three have a different
way of doing things (e.g. not using a standardized test framework or a variation of such).</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on this once I manage to get more info from upstream developers.</p>
<h2>Is URL Field in RPM Useless</h2>
<p>So is it? Opinions here differ from totally useless to "don't remove it, I need it".
However I run a small test and from 2574 RPMs on the source DVD there is around 
40% of "something different than HTTP 200 OK". This means <strong>40% potentially broken URLs</strong>!</p>
<p>The majority are responses in the 3XX range and only less than 10% are 
actual errors (4XX, 5XX, missing URLs or connection errors).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this can be removed from <code>rpm</code> altogether.
I don't think it will happen soon but if we don't use it why have it there? </p>
<p>My script for the test is
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/test-rpm-url-field.sh">here</a>.</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Around Christmas 2013
<a href="/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/">I said</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it looks like on average 30% of the packages execute their test suites at
build time in the %check section and less than 35% have test suites at all!
There’s definitely room for improvement and I plan to focus on this during 2014!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've recently started working on this goal by first identifying potential offending
packages and discussing the idea on Fedora's
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-February/thread.html">devel</a>,
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/packaging/2014-February/thread.html">packaging</a>
and <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-February/thread.html">test</a>
mailing lists.</p>
<p>May I present you nearly <strong>2000 packages</strong> which need your love:</p>

<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Missing_upstream_test_suites">wiki/QA/Missing_upstream_test_suites</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The intent for these pages is to serve as a source of working material for Fedora 
volunteers.</p>
<h2>How Can I Help</h2>

<h2>Important</h2>
<p>If you would like to gain some open source practice and QA experience I will
happily provide mentorship and general help so you can start working on Fedora.
Just ping me!</p>
