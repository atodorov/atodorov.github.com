<p>The code above works fine with curl-7.27 or older while it breaks with curl-7.29 and
newer. As explained by 
<a href="http://lists.baseurl.org/pipermail/yum-devel/2013-November/010428.html">Zdenek Pavlas</a>
the reason is an internal change in libcurl which doesn't accept a value of 1 anymore!</p>
<p>The bug is reproducible with a newer libcurl version and a vanilla urlgrabber==3.9.1
from PyPI (e.g. inside a virtualenv). The latest python-urlgrabber RPM packages in both
Fedora and Amazon Linux already have the fix.</p>
<p>I have tested the patch proposed by Zdenek and it works for me. I still have no idea why
there aren't any updates released on PyPI though!</p>

                <p><img alt="&quot;Beaker test lab&quot;" src="/images/fedora/beaker.png" title="Beaker test lab" /></p>
<p>In the last few weeks I've been working together with 
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tflink">Tim Flink</a> and
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kparal">Kamil Paral</a> from the Fedora QA
team on bringing some installation testing expertise to Fedora and establishing
an <a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/">open source test lab</a>
to perform automated testing in. The infrastructure is
already in relatively usable condition so I've decided to share this information
with the community. </p>
<h2>Beaker is Running Our Test Lab</h2>
<p><a href="http://beaker-project.org/">Beaker</a> is the software suite that powers the test
lab infrastructure. It is quite complex, with many components and sometimes not
very straight-forward to set up. Tim has been working on that with me giving it
a try and reporting issues as they have been discovered and fixed. </p>
<p>In the process of working on this I've managed to create
<a href="http://gerrit.beaker-project.org/#/q/owner:%22Alexander+Todorov%22,n,z">couple of patches</a>
against Beaker and friends. They are still pending release in a future version
because of more urgent bug fixes which need to released first.</p>
<h2>SNAKE is The Kickstart Template Server</h2>
<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> is a client/server Python framework used
to support Anaconda installations. It supports plain text ks.cfg files, IIRC those
were static templates, no variable substitution.</p>
<p>The other possibility is Python templates based on Pykickstart:</p>

<p>At the moment SNAKE is essentially abandoned but feature complete.
I'm thinking about adopting the project just in case we need to make some fixes.
Will let you know more about this when it happens. </p>
<h2>Open Source Test Suite</h2>
<p>I have been working on opening up several test cases for what we (QE) call
a tier #1 installation test suite. They can be found in
<a href="http://taskbot.cloud.fedoraproject.org/cgit/fedora-beaker-tests/">git</a>.
The tests are base on <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/beakerlib/">beakerlib</a> and
the legacy RHTS framework which is now part of Beaker.</p>
<p>This effort has been coordinated with Kamil as part of a pilot
project he's responsible for. I've been executing the same test suite against
earlier Fedora 20 snapshots but using an internal environment. Now everything
is going out in the open.</p>
<h2>Executing The Tests</h2>
<p>Well you can't do that - YET! There are command line client tools for Fedora
but Beaker and SNAKE are not well suited for use outside a restricted network
like LAN or VPN. There are issues with authentication most notably for SNAKE.</p>
<p>At the moment I have to ssh through two different systems to get proper access.
However this is been worked on. I've read about a rewrite which will allow Beaker
to utilize a custom authentication framework like FAS for example. Hopefully that
will be implemented soon enough.</p>
<p>I will also like to see the test systems have direct access to the Internet for
various reasons but this is not without its risks either. This is still to be
decided.</p>
<p>If you are interested anyway see the <code>kick-tests.sh</code> file in the test suite for
examples and command line options.</p>
<h2>Test Results</h2>
<p>The first successfully completed
<a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/jobs/">test jobs</a> are jobs 50 to 58.
There's a failure in one of the test cases, namely SELinux related 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1027148">RHBZ #1027148</a>.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the lab is now working as expected and we can start doing
some testing against Fedora development snapshots.</p>

                    Keeping Backwards Compatibility for pykickstart
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm using <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> templates as part of my
installation testing work;</li>
<li>SNAKE has a dependency on pykickstart;</li>
<li>To test the latest and greatest kickstart features in Fedora we need the
latest version of pykickstart;</li>
<li>Latest pykickstart needs Python 2.7</li>
<li>Python 2.7 is not available on RHEL 6 which is used to host the test
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just yesterday I hit an issue with the above setup and figured Fedora QA is
in a kind of strange situation - we always need the latest but need it
conservative enough to run on RHEL 6. See the original thread at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/kickstart-list/2013-November/msg00001.html">kickstart-list</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular case the solution will be to remove the offending code
and implement the same functionality in backward-compatible manner. Also add
more tests. I will be working on this tomorrow (there's an older patch already).</p>
<p>The BIG question remains though - how do you manage software evolution and still
keep it compatible with older execution stacks? Please share your experience in
the comments section.</p>
<hr />
<p>PP: Spoiler - this is part of an ongoing effort to bring open source installation
testing expertise (my domain) into Fedora world, plus establish a community supported
test infrastructure. More info TBA soon.</p>

<p>Here is my summary of the second Fedora Test Day hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Local attendance was a total disaster, in fact I was testing once again by my own.
This time
there were more people in the lab, all busy with their daily routines and tasks.
There were no people who came for the testing :(. I will have to try different
venues in the future and see if the situation improves.</p>
<p>On the testing front I managed to score 5 bugs against
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=709797,709799,709806,709810">GNOME</a>
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017807">Fedora</a>.
You can see the other test results and bugs on the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-10_Gnome_3.10">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>There are two things I didn't like in particular</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 as well as its classic mode - simply not the environment I'm used to;</li>
<li>Having to record test results in the wiki! I'm
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-October/118284.html">writing</a>
to the Fedora QA mailing list about that as we speak.</li>
</ul>
<p>At one time I was engaged in a discussion about which Bulgarian keyboard layout
should be the default in GNOME simply because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709799">GNOME #709799</a>. The default
keyboard layout will be Bulgarian (traditional phonetic) aka bg+phonetic.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>(16,13,26) rtcm: atodorov: are you bulgarian and/or live in bulgaria?
(16,14,20) rtcm: atodorov: if yes, I wanted to know which keyboard layout most people expect there to be the default
(16,16,34) atodorov: rtcm: I&#39;m a Bulgarian, however I can&#39;t tell which one. Both Phonetic and standard (BDS) are common
(16,16,54) atodorov: a safe bet is to go with phonetic I guess. 
(16,19,46) rtcm: atodorov: can you tell me which one is it in XKB terms? is it &quot;bg&quot;, &quot;bg+bas_phonetic&quot; or &quot;bg+phonetic&quot; ?
(16,20,51) rtcm: they&#39;re labeled as &quot;Bulgarian&quot;, &quot;Bulgarian (new phonetic)&quot; and &quot;Bulgarian (traditional phonetic)&quot;
(16,21,30) atodorov: bg+phonetic is the traditional phonetic
(16,22,04) atodorov: bg labeled as &quot;Bulgarian&quot; is the standard one I guess. Here we call it BDS after the standardization institute
(16,22,34) atodorov: bg+bas_phonetic is created from the Bulgarian Academy of Science and is not very popular as far as I know. I&#39;ve never seen it in use
(16,23,15) rtcm: atodorov: all I want to know is what most people would expect? like what does windows do by default? that&#39;s a good bet
(16,27,46) atodorov: rtcm: I&#39;m just being told that new Windows releases use yet another layout by default, which is like phonetic but with some characters in new places and people don&#39;t like that
(16,27,53) atodorov: my safe bet goes to bg+phonetic
(16,29,05) rtcm: ok, thanks

<p>It is a rare occasion when you get to make a decision that affects a large group
of people and I hope you don't hate me for that! </p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of the first Fedora Test Day in Sofia I hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> today.</p>
<p>Attendance was quite poor, actually nobody else except me participated but
almost nobody else visited the hackespace as well. I get that it is a
working day and Test Days conflict with regular business hours but this
is not going to change anyway. On the other hand where were all the freelancers
and non-office job workers who usually hang around in the Lab? I have no idea!</p>
<p>On IRC there was much better activity, 5 or 6 people were testing across
Asia, Europe and USA time zones. You can see the test results
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">here</a>.
I've started filing quite a few bugs in the morning and continued well into the
afternoon. I've managed to file a total of
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1016435,1016449,1016488,1016530,1016604,1016613,1016648,1016663,1016704,1016715">10 bugs</a>.
Some of them were not related to virtualization and some of them turned out to be
duplicates or not a bug. I even managed to file 2 duplicate bugs which likely have the
same root cause myself :). </p>
<p>I've also experienced two bugs filed by other people:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967371">RHBZ #967371</a> for MATE desktop
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1015636">RHBZ #1015636</a> for
virt-manager's Save/Restore functionality.</p>
<p>I've tried ARM on x86_64 but that didn't get anywhere near a running system.
I will make another post about ARM and what I've discovered there.</p>
<p>The one thing I liked is the 
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">test results application</a>.
It is not what I'm used to when dealing with RHEL, has far less features but is
very fast and easy to use and suits the Test Days participants just fine.
And is definitely much easier to use compared to filing results in the wiki.</p>
<p>Overall Fedora 20 virtualization status according to me is pretty good.</p>
<p>I hope to see more attendance <a href="http://initlab.org/event/gnome-test-day">on Thursday</a>
when we're going to test GNOME 3.10.</p>

                    Lenovo Rants: Battery and Dock Flaws
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>To all my readers - sorry for not being able to blog more frequently lately.
Here's an easy read about my favourite laptop brand Lenovo and some of their
design flaws I've found.</p>
<h2>X220 and T60 Batterries are ALMOST Identical</h2>
<p><img alt="&quot;X220 and T60 batteries&quot;" src="/images/lenovo_x220_t60_battery.jpg" title="X220 and T60 batteries" /></p>
<p>As you can see the <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">X220</a> and 
<a href="http://amzn.to/183SgiR">T60</a> batteries are nearly identical with the notable
exception of the connector placement. The end result - I have to purchase yet another
battery as a backup for long travel/work on the go. Not what I want.</p>
<p>I wish all Lenovo models had the same batteries so people can swap them around
as they wish. Is this too much to ask for? Have you seen another brand which
got this right? </p>
<h2>ThinkPad Mini Dock Design Flaw</h2>
<p>I'm using a <a href="http://amzn.to/15tjUYi">ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</a> docking station
with my X220 laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn't quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>
<p><img alt="docking station in position 2" src="/images/dock/alone.jpg" title="docking station in position 2" /></p>
<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>
<p><img alt="top view" src="/images/dock/top.jpg" title="top view" />
<img alt="back view" src="/images/dock/back.jpg" title="back view" />
<img alt="side view" src="/images/dock/side.jpg" title="side view" /></p>
<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>
<p><img alt="blocking part removed" src="/images/dock/removed.jpg" title="blocking part removed" /></p>
<p>Even with this piece removed my laptop still hets up too much! I guess 80 C is just
normal for the Core i7 processors :(.</p>
<p>Have you found something not quite right in your hardware design? Please share in the
comments.</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick 
some developers' ass this is the way to do it!</p>
<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov's „Oracle's take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>
<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

                <p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-ebugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">previous post</a>
I asked the readers of this blog to pick a bug number from Red Hat's Bugzilla
so I can analyze it later.</p>
<p><a href="http://radorado.me">Radoslav Georgiev</a> decided to step up and
selected the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">Leet</a> bug
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337</a></p>
<p>This is a rather old bug against kernel, in particular
against the token ring driver. There isn't much info on the bug but it seems
the issue is hardware dependent and doesn't reproduce reliably.</p>
<p>Looking at the bug status and history it looks like it was closed without
fixing it. Most likely the reason for this was there was no hardware
to test, bug was not reproduced and no customers were seeing the issue or
were willing to test and work with devel!</p>
<p>If you'd like to see my comments on other interesting bugs just post a link
to them in the comments section.</p>

<p>Red Hat's Bugzilla passed the 1 million bugs milestone yesterday!
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000">RHBZ #1000000</a> has been
filed by Anton Arapov, a kernel engineer and a very nice guy (I know him btw).
I've filed several bugs yesterday but the last one was #999941. A bit too short!</p>
<p>To celebrate this event I dare you to pick some bugs from Bugzilla that you find
interesting or frustrating and I will try to analyze and explain them from a
QA engineer's point of view. Since I've reported over 1000 bugs and been involved in
another close to 5000 I think I will be able to answer almost any question.</p>
<p>Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I've been having troubles with Twitter lately but this bug is just annoying!
Where on Earth is the "code below" ? I've already
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/370833992074809345">reported it</a>. Let's
see how long it takes for them to fix it!</p>

                    Notes From Two Interesting GUADEC Talks
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>As this year's <a href="https://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> is coming to an end
I'm publishing an interesting update from 
<a href="https://cz.linkedin.com/in/mullerpetr">Petr Muller</a> for 
those who were not able to attend.
Petr is a Senior Quality Engineer at Red Hat. His notes were
sent to an internal QE mailing list and re-published with permission.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>As this year&#39;s GUADEC happened in the same building where I have my
other office, I decided to attend. I&#39;m sharing my notes from the two
sessions I consider to be especially interesting for the audience of
this mailing list:

== How to not report your UX bug ==
Speaker:    Fabiana Simões
Blog:       http://fabianapsimoes.wordpress.com/
Twitter:    https://twitter.com/fabianapsimoes

Do not do this stuff:
* Do not simply present a preferred solution, but describe a problem (a
difficulty you are having, etc.)
* Do not use &quot;This sucks&quot; idiom, not even hidden in false niceties like
&quot;It&#39;s not user friendly&quot;
* Do not talk for majority, when you are not entitled to (&quot;most users
would like&quot;)
* Do not consider all UX issues as minor: an inability to do stuff is
not a minor issue

What is actually interesting for the designer in a report?
* What were you trying to do?
* Why did you want to do it?
* What did you do?
* What happened?
* What were your expectations?

More notes
* Write as much as needed
* Describe what you see, did and *how you felt*
* Print screen is your friend!
* *Give praise*

== Extreme containment measures: keeping bug reports under control ==
Speaker:  Jean-Francois Fortin Tam
Homepage: http://jeff.ecchi.ca
Twitter:  https://twitter.com/nekohayo

Discussed the problem lot of OS projects are having: lot of useless
(old, irrelevant, waiting for decision no one wants to make) bug/rfe
reports in their bug tracking systems. Lots of food for thought about
our own projects, internal or external. Clever applications of
principles from personal productivity systems such as GTD and Inbox Zero
for bug tracking.  

The talk was mostly an applied version of this blog post, which is worth
reading:
http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/10/08/reducing-our-core-apps-software-inventory/
</pre></div>


<p>I particularly like the UX bug reporting guide lines. Need to take those into
account when reporting UI issues. </p>
<p>I still haven't read the second blog post which also looks interesting although 
not very applicable to me. After all I'm the person reporting bugs not the one
who decides what and when gets fixed.</p>

                    Performance test: Amazon ElastiCache vs Amazon S3
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Which Django cache backend is faster? Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon S3 ?</p>
<p>Previously I've mentioned about
<a href="/blog/2013/06/19/django-tips-using-cache-for-stateful-http/">using Django's cache to keep state between HTTP requests</a>.
In my demo described there I was using <a href="http://github.com/atodorov/django-s3-cache">django-s3-cache</a>.
It is time to move to production so I decided to measure the performance difference between the two
cache options available at Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013-07-01</strong>: my initial test may have been false since I had not configured
ElastiCache access properly. I saw no errors but discovered the issue today on another
system which was failing to store the cache keys but didn't show any errors either. 
I've re-run the tests and updated times are shown below.</p>
<h2>Test infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>One Amazon S3 bucket, located in US Standard (aka US East) region;</li>
<li>One Amazon ElastiCache cluster with one Small Cache Node (cache.m1.small) with Moderate I/O capacity;</li>
<li>One Amazon Elasticache cluster with one Large Cache Node (cache.m1.large) with High I/O Capacity;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> I've tested both <code>python-memcached</code> and <code>pylibmc</code> client libraries for Django;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Test is executed from an EC2 node in the us-east-1a availability zone;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Cache clusters are in the us-east-1a availability zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Scenario</h2>
<p>The test platform is Django. I've created a
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/Amazon-ElastiCache-vs-Amazon-S3-Django">skeleton project</a>
with only <code>CACHES</code> settings
defined and necessary dependencies installed. A file called <code>test.py</code> holds the
test cases, which use the standard timeit module. The object which is stored in cache
is very small - it holds a phone/address identifiers and couple of user made selections.
The code looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">timeit</span>

<span class="n">s3_set</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">timeit</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Timer</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">for i in range(1000):</span>
<span class="sd">    my_cache.set(i, MyObject)</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">from django.core import cache</span>

<span class="sd">my_cache = cache.get_cache(&#39;default&#39;)</span>

<span class="sd">MyObject = {</span>
<span class="sd">    &#39;from&#39; : &#39;359123456789&#39;,</span>
<span class="sd">    &#39;address&#39; : &#39;6afce9f7-acff-49c5-9fbe-14e238f73190&#39;,</span>
<span class="sd">    &#39;hour&#39; : &#39;12:30&#39;,</span>
<span class="sd">    &#39;weight&#39; : 5,</span>
<span class="sd">    &#39;type&#39; : 1,</span>
<span class="sd">}</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">s3_get</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">timeit</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Timer</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">for i in range(1000):</span>
<span class="sd">    MyObject = my_cache.get(i)</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">from django.core import cache</span>

<span class="sd">my_cache = cache.get_cache(&#39;default&#39;)</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<p>Tests were executed from the Django shell <del>on my laptop</del>
on an EC2 instance in the us-east-1a availability zone. ElastiCache nodes
were freshly created/rebooted before test execution. S3 bucket had no objects.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As expected ElastiCache is much faster (10x) compared to S3. However the difference
between the two ElastiCache node types is subtle. I will stay with the smallest
possible node to minimize costs. Also as seen, pylibmc is a bit faster compared to
the pure Python implementation. </p>
<p>Depending on your objects size or how many set/get operations you perform per
second you may need to go with the larger nodes. Just test it!</p>
<p><del>It surprised me how slow django-s3-cache is.</del>
The false test showed django-s3-cache to be 100x slower but new results are better.
10x decrease in performance sounds about right for a filesystem backed cache.</p>
<p>A quick look at the code
of the two backends shows some differences. The one I immediately see is that
for every cache key django-s3-cache creates an sha1 hash which is used as the
storage file name. This was modeled after the filesystem backend but I think the
design is wrong - the memcached backends don't do this.</p>
<p>Another one is that django-s3-cache time-stamps all objects and uses pickle to serialize them. 
I wonder if it can't just write them as binary blobs directly. There's definitely lots
of room for improvement of django-s3-cache. I will let you know my findings once I
get to it. </p>

<p>Here's a small but very visible UI bug in Facebook. While selecting for which
applications to receive or not notifications there is a small progress bar image
that appears left of the checkbox element. The trouble is this image displaces the
checkbox and it appears to float right and left during the AJAX call. This is annoying.</p>
<p>There's an easy fix - either fix the progress image and checkbox positions so they don't move
or place the image to the right.</p>
<p>In my practice these types of bugs are common. I usually classify them with High priority,
because they tend to annoy the user and generate support calls or just look unprofessional.</p>

As seen above when clicking the Like button the widget would overlap with

the user from sharing the page via Facebook which is important for a blog.</p>

                    Linux and Python Tools To Compare Images
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>How to compare two images in Python? A tricky question with quite a few answers.
Since my needs are simple, my solution is simpler!</p>
<p><img src="/images/difio_compare.png" alt="Difio Google +1 changes" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
<a href="http://www.dif.io">dif.io</a> homepage before and after it got a G+1.</p>
<h2>ImageMagic is magic</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagic</a> then you've been
living in a cave on a deserted island! The suite contains the <code>compare</code> command
which mathematically and visually annotates the difference between two images.</p>
<p>The third image above was produced with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>compare difio_10.png difio_11.png difio_diff.png
</pre></div>


<p>Differences are displayed in red (default) and the original image is seen in the
background. As shown, the Google +1 button and count has changed between the two
images. <code>compare</code> is a nice tool for manual inspection and debugging.
It works well in this case because the images are lossless PNGs and are regions of
screen shots where most objects are the same.</p>
<p><img src="/images/chestnut_compare.jpg" alt="JPEG quality reduction" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
Chestnuts I had in Rome. 100% to 99% quality reduction.</p>
<p>As seen on the second image set only 1% of JPEG quality change leads to many small
differences in the image, which are invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<h2>Python Imaging Library aka PIL</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> is another powerful tool for
image manipulation. I googled around and found some answers to my original
questions
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1927660/compare-two-images-the-python-linux-way">here</a>.
The proposed solution is to calculate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square">RMS</a> of the two images
and compare that with some threshold to establish the level of certainty that
two images are identical.</p>
<h2>Simple solution</h2>
<p>I've been working on a script lately which needs to know what is displayed on
the screen and recognize some of the objects. Calculating image similarity is
quite complex but comparing if two images are <strong>exactly</strong> identical is not.
Given my environment and the fact
that I'm comparing screen shots where only few areas changed
(see first image above for example) led to the following solution: </p>
<ul>
<li>Take a screen shot;</li>
<li>Crop a particular area of the image which needs to be examined;</li>
<li>Compare to a baseline image of the same area created manually;</li>
<li>Don't use RMS, use the image histogram only to speed up calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've prepared the baseline images with GIMP and tested couple of scenarios
using <code>compare</code>. Here's how it looks in code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">PIL</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Image</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">dogtail.utils</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">screenshot</span>

<span class="n">baseline_histogram</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/home/atodorov/baseline.png&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">histogram</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">screenshot</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">img</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">crop</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">860</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">950</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">region</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">histogram</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">baseline_histogram</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The presented solution was easy to program, works fast and reliably for my use case.
In fact after several iterations I've added a second baseline image to account for some
unidentified noise which appears randomly in the first region. As far as I can tell
the two checks combined are 100% accurate. </p>
<h2>Field of application</h2>
<p>I'm working on QA automation where this comes handy. However you may try some
lame CAPTCHA recognition by comparing regions to a pre-defined baseline. Let me know
if you come up with a cool idea or actually used this in code. </p>
<p>I'd love to hear
about interesting projects which didn't get too complicated because of image
recognition.</p>

KBGB 3864 refrigerator, caused by what looks like a race-condition.</p>
<p>This appliance starts beeping in case the door is left open for more than 60 seconds.
The alarm stops if door is closed or can be muted manually while the door is still open.</p>
<h2>The Bug</h2>
<p>It happened so that I had the door open for nearly one minute and as it was closing 
I heard a beep. This time however the beeping didn't stop after the door had closed.
The alarm continued beeping with the door closed so I tried to re-open and close it again.
It didn't stop! I had to open the door and manually mute the alarm for it to stop. </p>
<div style="display:block; clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>

<h2>The Root Cause</h2>
<p>While not entirely sure, I think the reason for this malfunction
was a race-condition. The alarm went on at nearly the same time when the 
controlling timer should have gone off (when closing the door).</p>
<h2>Steps To Reproduce</h2>
<p>I tried reproducing several times afterwards by opening and closing the door
at the last possible moment. I used a stop-watch to time my actions. However
I wasn't able to reproduce twice. Every time I tried, there was only one single
beep as the door was closing and no more.</p>
<p>I guess then, like we say in QE, <em>WORKS FOR ME</em>!</p>
