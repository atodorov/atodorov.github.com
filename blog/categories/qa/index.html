                    Automatic cargo update & pull requests for Rust projects
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>If you follow my blog you are aware that I use automated tools to do some
boring tasks instead of me. For example they can detect when new versions of
dependencies I'm using are available and then schedule testing against them on the fly.</p>
<p>One of these tools is
<a href="http://mrsenko.com/blog/mr-senko/2016/05/18/triggering-automatic-dependency-testing/">Strazar</a>
which I use heavily for my Django based packages.
Example: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/atodorov/django-s3-cache/builds/218758538">django-s3-cache build job</a>.</p>
<p>Recently I've made a slightly different proof-of-concept for a Rust project.
Because rustc and various dependencies (called crates) are updated very often
we didn't want to expand the test matrix like Strazar does. Instead we wanted to
always build &amp; test against the latest crates versions and if that passes
create a pull request for the update (in <code>Cargo.lock</code>). All of this unattended
of course!</p>
<p>To start create a cron job in Travis CI which will execute once per day and call your
test script. The script looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><span class="filename">cargo-update-and-pr</span><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$GITHUB_TOKEN</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;GITHUB_TOKEN is not defined&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">exit </span>1
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="nv">BRANCH_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;automated_cargo_update&quot;</span>

git checkout -b <span class="nv">$BRANCH_NAME</span>
cargo update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> cargo <span class="nb">test</span>

<span class="nv">DIFF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>git diff<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="c"># NOTE: we don&#39;t really check the result from testing here. Only that</span>
<span class="c"># something has been changed, e.g. Cargo.lock</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -n <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$DIFF</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="c"># configure git authorship</span>
    git config --global user.email <span class="s2">&quot;atodorov@MrSenko.com&quot;</span>
    git config --global user.name <span class="s2">&quot;Alexander Todorov&quot;</span>

    <span class="c"># add a remote with read/write permissions!</span>
    <span class="c"># use token authentication instead of password</span>
    git remote add authenticated https://atodorov:<span class="nv">$GITHUB_TOKEN</span>@github.com/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs.git

    <span class="c"># commit the changes to Cargo.lock</span>
    git commit -a -m <span class="s2">&quot;Auto-update cargo crates&quot;</span>

    <span class="c"># push the changes so that PR API has something to compare against</span>
    git push authenticated <span class="nv">$BRANCH_NAME</span>

    <span class="c"># finally create the PR</span>
    curl -X POST -H <span class="s2">&quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</span> -H <span class="s2">&quot;Authorization: token </span><span class="nv">$GITHUB_TOKEN</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         --data <span class="s1">&#39;{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Auto-update cargo crates&quot;,&quot;head&quot;:&quot;automated_cargo_update&quot;,&quot;base&quot;:&quot;master&quot;, &quot;body&quot;:&quot;@atodorov review&quot;}&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
         https://api.github.com/repos/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/pulls
<span class="k">fi</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A few notes here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to define a secret <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable for authentication;</li>
<li>The script doesn't force push, but in practice that may be useful (e.g. updating the PR);</li>
<li>The script doesn't have any error handling;</li>
<li>If PR is still open GitHub will tell us about it but we ignore the result here;</li>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> paste this into your <code>Makefile</code> because the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable will be
  expanded into the logs and your secrets go away! Always call the script from your
  <code>Makefile</code> to avoid revealing secrets.</li>
<li>I am using topic branches because this is a POC. Switch to <em>master</em> and maybe move
  all URLs as variables at the top of the script!</li>
<li>I run this cron build against a fork of the project because the team doesn't feel
  comfortable having automated commits/pushes. I also create the pull requests against
  my own fork. You will have to adjust the targets if you want your PR to go to the
  original repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the PR which was created by this script:
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/pull/5">https://github.com/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/pull/5</a></p>
<p>Notice that it includes previous commits b/c they have not been merged to the master branch!</p>
<p>Here's the test job (#77) which generated this PR:
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/builds/219274916">https://travis-ci.org/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/builds/219274916</a></p>
<p>Here's a test job (#87) which bails out miserably because the PR already exists:
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/builds/220954269">https://travis-ci.org/atodorov/bdcs-api-rs/builds/220954269</a></p>
<p>This post is part of my <em>Quality Assurance According to Einstein</em> series - a detailed description
of useful techniques I will be presenting very soon.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In a <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/">previous post</a> I
have shown an example of real world bugs which we were not able to detect
despite having 100% mutation and test coverage. I am going to show you another
example here.</p>
<p>This example comes from one of my training courses. The task is to write a
class which represents a bank account with methods to deposit, withdraw and
transfer money. The solution looks like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><span class="filename">bank.py</span><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankAccount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>Notice that if withdrawal is not possible then the function returns <code>False</code>. The tests
look like this</p>

<p>The problem is that when <code>self.withdraw(how_much)</code> fails <code>transfer_to()</code> ignores
the result and tries to deposit the money into the other account! A better
implementation would be</p>

</pre></div>


<p>In my earlier article the bugs were caused by external environment
and tools/metrics like code coverage and mutation score are not affected by it.
In fact the jinja-ab example falls into the category of data coverage testing.</p>
<p>The current example on the other hand is ignoring the return value of the <code>withdraw()</code>
function and that's why it fails when we add the appropriate test.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> some mutation test tools support the <em>removing/modifying return value</em>
mutation. Cosmic Ray doesn't support this at the moment (I should add it). Even if it did
that would not help us find the bug because we would kill the mutation using
the <code>test_withdraw...()</code> test methods, which already assert on the return value!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

<p>Due to popular demand I'm sharing my plans for the upcoming conference season.
Here is a list of events I plan to visit and speak at (hopefully). The list
will be updated throughout the year so please subscribe to the comments section
to receive a notification when that happens! I'm open to meeting new people so
ping me for a beer if you are attending some of these events!</p>
<h2>02 February - Hack Belgium Pre-Event Workshops, Brussels</h2>
<p><strong>Note: added on Jan 12th</strong></p>
<p>Last year I had an amazing time visiting an
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">Elixir &amp; Erlang workshop</a> so
I'm about to repeat the experience. I will be visiting a
<a href="http://www.hackathon.com/event/hack-belgium-pre-event-workshops-29372270251">workshop</a>
organized by HackBelgium and keep you posted with the results.</p>
<h2>03 February - Git Merge, Brussels</h2>
<p><strong>Note: added on Jan 12th</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://git-merge.com/">Git Merge</a> is organized by GitHub and will be held in Brussels
this year. I will be visiting only the conference track and hopefully giving a lightning talk
titled <em>Automatic upstream dependency testing with GitHub API</em>! That and the afterparty
of course!</p>
<h2>04-05 February - FOSDEM, Brussels</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/">FOSDEM</a> is the largest free and open source gathering
in Europe which I have been visiting since 2009 (IIRC). You can checkout some
of my reports about
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-1-python-stands-lightning-talks/">FOSDEM 2014, Day 1</a>,
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/">FOSDEM 2014, Day 2</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">FOSDEM 2016</a>.</p>
<p>I will present my
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/mutant_testing/">Mutants, tests and zombies</a>
talk at the <em>Testing &amp; Automation devroom</em> on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Video recording is available
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyKvwODy9jw&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">here</a></p>
<p>I will be in Brussels between February 1st and 5th to explore the local
start-up scene and get to meet with the Python community so ping me if you are around.</p>
<h2>18 March - QA Challenge Accepted 3.0, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="http://qachallengeaccepted.com/">QA: Challenge Accepted</a> is a specialized QA conference
in Sofia and most of the sessions are in Bulgarian. I've visited last year and it was great.
I even proposed a <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/03/25/hello-world-qa-challenge/">challenge of my own</a>.</p>
<p>CFP is still open but I have a strong confidence that my talk
<em>Testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux the MicroSoft way</em> will be approved. It will describe
a large scale experiment with pairwise testing, which btw I learned about at
QA: Challenge Accepted 2.0 :).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I will be also on the jury for <em>QA of the year</em> award.</p>
<h2>07-08 April - Bulgaria Web Summit, Sofia</h2>
<p>I have been a moderator at
<a href="https://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a> for several years and this year
is no exception. This is one of the strongest events held in Sofia and is in English.
Last year over 60% of the attendees were from abroad so you are welcome!</p>
<p>I'm not going to speak at this event but will record as much of it
as possible. Checkout earlier recordings on my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">YouTube</a> channel
and hurry up because tickets are almost sold out!</p>
<h2>10-12 May - Romanian Testing Conference, Cluj-Napoca</h2>
<p><a href="http://romaniatesting.ro/">RTC'17</a> is a new event I found in neighboring Romania.
The topic this year is <em>Thriving and remaining relevant in Quality Assurance</em>. My talk is titled
<em>Quality Assistance in the Brave New World</em> where I'll share some experiences
and visions for the QA profession if that gets accepted.</p>
<p>As it turned out I know a few people living in Cluj so I'll be arriving one day earlier
on May 9th to meet the locals.</p>
<h2>13-14 May - OSCAL, Tirana</h2>
<p><a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/">Open Source Conference Albania</a> is the largest OSS event in
the country. I'm on a row here to explore the IT scene on the Balkans. Due to traveling
constraints my availability will be limited to the conference venue only but I've booked
a hotel across the street :).</p>
<p>I will be meeting a few friends in Tirana and hear about the progress of an
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/21/women-in-open-source/">psychological experiment</a> we devised
with Jona Azizaj and Suela Palushi.</p>
<p>Talking wise I'm hoping to get the chance of introducing mutation testing and
even host a workshop on the topic.</p>
<h2>20-21 May - DEVit, Thessaloniki</h2>
<p>This is the 3rd edition of <a href="http://devitconf.org/">DEVit</a>,
the 360° web development conference of Northern Greece. I've been a regular
visitor since the beginning and this year I've proposed a session on mutation
testing. Because the Thessaloniki community seems more interested in Ruby and Rails
my goal is to share more examples from my Ruby work and compare how that is different
from the Python world. There is once again an opportunity for a workshop.</p>
<p>So far I've been the only Bulgarian to visit DEVit and also locally known as
"The guy who Kosta &amp; Kosta met in Sofia"! Checkout my impressions from
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/05/22/devit-conf-2015-impressions/">DEVit'15</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/05/25/devit-conf-2016/">DEVit'16</a>
if you are still wondering whether to attend or not! I strongly recommend it!</p>
<h2>01-02 June - Shift Developer Conference, Split</h2>
<p><a href="http://shift.codeanywhere.com/">Shift</a> appears to be a very big event in Croatia.
My attendance is still unconfirmed due to lots of traveling before that and
the general trouble of efficiently traveling on the Balkans. However I have a
CFP submitted and waiting for approval. This time it is my
<em>Mutation Testing in Patterns</em>, which is a journal of different code patterns
found during mutation testing. I have not yet presented it to the public
but will blog about it sometime soon so stay tuned.</p>
<h2>03-04 June - TuxCon, Plovdiv</h2>
<p><a href="http://tuxcon.mobi/">TuxCon</a> is held in Plovdiv around the beginning of July.
I'm usually presenting some lightning talks there and use the opportunity to
meet with friends and peers outside Sofia and catch up with news from the
local community. The conference is in Bulgarian with the exception of the
occasional foreign speaker. If you understand Bulgarian I recommend the
story of
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/07/12/testing-the-8-bit-computer-puldin/">Puldin - a Bulgarian computer from the 80s</a>.</p>
<h2>17-18 June - How Camp, Varna</h2>
<p><a href="http://how.camp/">How Camp</a> is the little brother of Bulgaria Web Summit and is always
held outside of Sofia. This year it will be in Varna, Bulgaria. I will be there of course
and depending on the crowd may talk about some software testing patterns.</p>
<h2>September or October - SEETEST, The Balkans</h2>
<p><a href="http://seetest.org">South East European Software Testing Conference</a> is, AFAIK,
an international event which is hosted in a major city on the Balkans. Last year it was
held in Bucharest with previous years held in Sofia.</p>
<p>In my view this is the most formal event, especially related to software testing,
I'm about to visit. Nevertheless I like to hear about new ideas and some research
in the field of QA so this is a good opportunity. I'm not planning to speak at
this event!</p>
<h2>21-22 October - HackConf, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="https://hackconf.bg">HackConf</a> is one of the largest conferences in Bulgaria, gathering
over 1000 people each year. I am strongly affiliated with the people who organize it
and even had the opportunity to host the opening session last year. The picture above
is from this event.</p>
<p>The audience is still very young and inexperienced but the presenters are above average.
Organizers' goal is HackConf to become the strongest technical conference in the country
and also serve as a sort of inspiration for young IT professionals.</p>
<p>Each year the conference has a topic and I have no idea what the topic for 2017 will be.
In any case I think I will have something interesting to share with the public.</p>
<h2>October - IT Weekend, Bulgaria</h2>
<p><a href="http://it-weekend.com/">IT Weekend</a> is organized by Petar Sabev, the same person who's
behind QA: Challenge Accepted. It is a non-formal gathering of engineers with the intent
to share some news and then discuss and share problems and experiences. Checkout my
review of
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/">IT Weekend #1</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/02/it-weekend-highlights/">IT Weekend #3</a>.</p>
<p>The topic revolve around QA, leadership and management but the format is open and the
intention is to broaden the topics covered. The event is held outside Sofia at a SPA
hotel and makes for a very nice retreat. I don't have a topic but I'm definitely going
if time allows. I will probably make something up if we have QA slots available :).</p>
<h2>October - Software Freedom Kosova, Prishtina</h2>
<p><a href="http://sfk.flossk.org">Software Freedom Kosova</a> is one of the oldest conferences
about free and open source software in the region.
This is part of my goal to explore the IT communities on the Balkans.
Kosovo sounds a bit strange to visit but I did recognize a few names on the speaker
list of previous years.</p>
<p>The CFP is not open yet but I'm planning to make a presentation. Also if weather
allows I'm planning a road trip on my motorbike :).</p>
<h2>16-17 November - ISTA Con, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="https://istacon.org/">Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation</a> started as a QA conference
several years ago but it has broaden the range of acceptable topics to include
development, devops and agile. I was at the first two editions and then didn't attend
for a while until <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/30/highlights-from-ista-and-gtac-2016/">last year</a> when I
really liked it. The event is entirely in English with lots of foreign speakers.</p>
<p>Recently I've been working on something I call "Regression Test Monitoring" and my
intention is to present this at ISTA 2017 so stay tuned.</p>
<h2>November - Google Test Automation Conference, London</h2>
<p>There are no dates announced for
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/">GTAC 2017</a>
but it will be held in London. Both speakers and attendees are pre-approved
and my goal is to be the second Bulgarian to speak at GTAC.</p>
<p>The previous two years saw talks about
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/">mutation testing vs. coverage</a>
and their respective use
to determine the quality of a test suite with both parties arguing against
each other. Since I'm working in both of these fields and have at least one
practical example I'm trying to gather more information and present my findings
to the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and see you around!</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="QA 101 graduation" src="/images/qa101_final.jpg" title="QA 101 graduation" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of this year I've hosted the first QA related course at
<a href="http://hackbulgaria.com/">HackBulgaria</a>. This is a long overdue post about
how the course went, what worked well and what didn't. Brace yourself because
it is going to be a long one.</p>
<p>The idea behind a QA course has been lurking in both RadoRado's (from HackBulgaria)
and my heads for quite a while. We've been discussing it at least a year before we
actually started. One day Rado told me he'd found a sponsor and we have the go ahead
for the course and that's how it all started!</p>
<p>The first issue was that we weren't prepared to start at a moments notice. I literally
had two weeks to prepare
<a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101">the curriculum</a>
and <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/12/how-to-hire-software-testers-pt-1/">initial interview questions</a>.
Next we opened the application form and left it open until the last possible moment.
I've been reviewing candidate answers hours before the course started, which was
another mistake we made!</p>
<p>On the positive side is that I hosted a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgu0VTxytYw&amp;index=37&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">Q&amp;A session on YouTube</a>
answering general questions about the profession and the course itself. This
live stream helped popularize the course.</p>
<p>At the start we had 30 people and around 13 of them managed to "graduate"
till the final lesson. The biggest portion of students dropped out after the
first 5 lessons of Java crash course! Each lesson was around 4 hours with 20-30
minutes break in the middle.</p>
<p>With respect to the criteria find a first job or find a new/better job I consider the
training successful. To my knowledge all students have found better jobs, many of them
as software testers!</p>
<p>On the practical side of things students managed to find and report 11 interesting
bugs against Fedora. Mind you that these were all found in the wild:
<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5323">fedora-infrastructure #5323</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339701">RHBZ#1339701</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339709">RHBZ#1339709</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339713">RHBZ#1339713</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339719">RHBZ#1339719</a>,

<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340891">RHBZ#1340891</a>.</p>
<p>Then students also made a few pull requests on GitHub (3 which I know off):
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-math/pull/38">commons-math #38</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-csv/pull/12">commons-csv #12</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-email/pull/1">commons-email #1</a>.</p>
<h2>Lesson format</h2>
<p>For reference most lessons were a mix of short presentation about theory and best practices
followed by discussions and where appropriate practical sessions with technology or
projects. The exercises were designed for individual work, work in pairs or small groups (4-5)
on purpose.</p>
<p>By request from the sponsors I've tried to keep a detailed record of each student's
performance and personality traits as much as I was able to observe them. I really enjoyed
keeping such a journal but didn't share this info with my students which I consider
a negative issue. I think knowing where your strong and weak areas are would help you
become a better expert in your field!</p>
<h2>Feedback from students</h2>
<ul>
<li>There was little time (to work on the practical examples I guess);</li>
<li>Not having particular practical tasks was a problem. For example we didn't have tasks of the
sort do "X" then "Y";</li>
<li>They needed more time and more attention to be given to them;</li>
<li>Installing different pieces of software and tools took a lot of time and frustration.
It was also quite problematic sometimes depending on whether they used Linux, Windows or Mac OS X;</li>
<li>Working with Eclipse IDE was horrible. Nobody new what to do and the interface
wasn't newbie friendly. Also it took quite a lot of time to install dependencies and/or
import projects to run in Eclipse;</li>
<li>There were a few problems with Selenium and its different versions being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to point out that while these are valid concerns and major issues students were
at least partially guilty for the last 3 of them. It was my impression that most of them
didn't prepare at home, didn't read the next lesson and didn't install prerequisite
tools and software!</p>
<h2>5x Java Crash Course</h2>
<p>We've started with a Java crash course as requested by our sponsors which was extended to
5 instead of the original 3 sessions. RadoRado was teaching Java fundamentals while
I was assisting him with comments.</p>
<p>On the good side is that Rado explains very well and in much details. He also writes code
to demonstrate what he teaches and while doing so uses only the knowledge he's presented
so far. For example if there's a repeating logic/functionality he would just write it
twice instead of refactoring that into a separate function with parameters (assuming
the students have not learned about functions yet). I think this made it more easier
to understand the concepts being taught.</p>
<p>Another positive thing we did was me going behind Rado's computer and modifying some
of the code while he was explaining something on screen. If you take the above example
and have two methods with print out salutations, e.g. "Good morning, Alex" I would go
and modify one of them to include "Mr." while the other will not. This introduced a
change in behavior which ultimately results in a bug! This was a nice practical way
to demonstrate how some classes of bugs get introduced in reality. We did only a few of
these behind the computer changes and I definitely liked them! They were all ad-hoc,
not planned for.</p>
<p>On the negative side Java seems hard to learn and after these 5 lessons half of the
students dropped out. Maybe part of the reason is they didn't expect to start a QA
course with lessons about programming. But that also means they didn't pay enough
attention to the curriculum, which was announced in advance!</p>
<h2>Lesson 01 - QA Fundamentals</h2>
<p>I had made a point to assign time constraints to each exercise in the lessons.
While that mostly worked in the first few lessons, where there is more theory,
we didn't keep the schedule and were overtime.</p>
<p>Explaining testing theory (based on ISTQB fundamentals) took longer than I expected.
it was also evident that we needed more written examples of what different test
analysis techniques are (e.g. boundary value analysis). Here Petar Sabev helped
me deliver few very nice examples.</p>
<p>One of the exercises was "when to stop testing" with an example of a Sudoku solving
function and different environments in which this code operates, e.g. browser, mobile,
etc. Students appeared to have a hard time understanding what a
"runtime environment" is and define relevant tests based on that! I believe most
of the students, due to lack of knowledge and experience, were also having a hard time grasping the
concept of non-functional testing.</p>
<p>A positive thing was that students started explaining to one another and giving
examples for bugs they've seen outside the course.</p>
<h2>Lesson 02 - Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<p>This lesson was designed as role playing game to demonstrate the most common
software development methodologies - waterfall and agile and discuss the QA role
in both of them. The format by itself is very hard to conduct successfully and
this was my first time ever doing this. I've also never taken part of such games
until then, only heard about them.</p>
<p>During the waterfall exercise it was harder for the students to follow the game
constraints and not exchange information with one another because they were sitting
on the same table.</p>
<p>On the positive side all groups came with unique ideas about software features and how
they want to develop them. Timewise we managed to do very well. On the negative side
is that I was the client for all groups and didn't manage to pay enough attention
to everyone, which btw is what clients usually do in real life.</p>
<h2>Lesson 03 - Bug Tracking</h2>
<p>This lesson was a practical exercise in writing bug reports and figuring out what
information needs to be present in a good bug report. Btw this is something I
always ask junior members at job interviews.</p>
<p>First we started with working in pairs to define what a good bug report is
without actually knowing what that means. Students found it hard to brainstorm
together and most of them worked alone during this exercise.</p>
<p>Next students had to write bug reports for some example bugs, which I've explained briefly
on purpose and perform peer reviews of their bugs. Reviews took a long time to complete
but overall students had a good idea of what information to include in a bug report.</p>
<p>Then, after learning from their mistakes and hearing what others had done, they've
learned about some good practices and were tasked to rewrite their bug reports using
the new knowledge. I really like the approach of letting students make some mistakes
and then showing them the easier/better way of doing things. This is also on-par with
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/">Ivan Nemytchenko's methodology</a> of
letting his interns learn by their mistakes.</p>
<p>All bug reports can be found in students repositories, which are forked from the
curriculum. Check out <a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network">https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network</a>.</p>
<p>I should have really asked everyone to file bugs under the curriculum repository so
it is easier for me to track them. On the other hand I wanted each student to start building
their own public profile to show potential employers.</p>
<h2>Lesson 04 - Test Case Management</h2>
<p>This lesson started with an exercise asking students to create accounts for
Red Hat's OpenShift cloud platform in the form of a test scenario. The scenario intentionally
left out some details. The idea being that missing information introduces inconsistencies
during testing and to demonstrate how the same steps were performed slightly differently.</p>
<p>We had some troubles explaining exactly "how did you test" because most inexperienced people
would not remember all details about where they clicked, did they use the mouse or the
keyboard, was the tab order correct, etc. Regardless students managed to receive different
results and discover that some email providers were not supported.</p>
<p>The homework assignment was to create test plans and test cases in Nitrate at
<a href="https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/">https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/</a>. Unfortunately the system appears to be down ATM
and I don't have time to investigate why. This piece of infrastructure was put together
in 2 hours and I'm surprised it lasted without issues during the entire course.</p>
<h2>2x Introduction to Linux</h2>
<p>This was a crash course in Linux fundamentals and exercise with most common commands
and text editors in the console. Most of the students were not prepared with virtual
machines. We've also used a cloud provider to give students remote shell but the
provider API was failing and we had to deploy docker containers manually. Overall
infrastructure was a big problem but we somehow managed. Another problem was with
ssh clients from Windows who generated keys in a format that our cloud provider
couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Wrt commands and exercises students did well and managed to execute most of them
on their own. That's very good for people who've never seen a terminal in their lives
(more or less).</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Testing Fedora 24(25) Changes</h2>
<p>Once again nobody was prepared with a virtual machine with Fedora and students
were installing software as we go. Because of that we didn't manage to conduct
the lesson properly and had to repeat it on the next session.</p>
<p>Rawhide being the bleeding edge of Fedora means it is full of bugs. Well I couldn't
keep up with everyone and explain workarounds or how to install/upgrade Fedora.
That was a major setback. It also became evident that you can't move quickly
if you have no idea what to do and no instructions about it either.</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Again</h2>
<p>Once prepared with the latest and greatest from Rawhide the task was to analyze the
proposed feature changes (on the Fedora wiki) and create test plans and design
test cases for said changes. Then execute the tests in search for bugs. This is where
some of the bugs above came from. The rest were found during upgrades.</p>
<p>This lesson was team work (4-5 students) but the results were mixed. IMO Fedora changes
are quite hard to grasp, especially if you lack domain knowledge and broader knowledge
about the structure and operation of a Linux distribution. I don't think most teams
were able to clearly understand their chosen features and successfully create good
plans/scenarios for them. On the other hand in real life software you don't necessarily
understand the domain better and know what to do. I've been in situations where
whole features have been defined by a single sentence and requested to be tested by QA.</p>
<p>One of the teams didn't manage to install Fedora (IIRC they didn't have laptops
capable of running a VM) and were not able to conduct the exercise.</p>
<p>Being able to find real life bugs, some of them serious, and getting traction in Bugzilla
is the most positive effect of this lesson. I personally wanted to have more output
(e.g. more bugs, more cases defined, etc) but taking into account the blocking factors
and setbacks I think this is a good initial result.</p>
<h2>Lesson 06 - Unit Testing and Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Here we had a few examples of bad stubs and mocks which were not received very well.
The topic is hard in itself and wasn't very well explained with practical examples.</p>
<p>Another negative thing is that students took a lot of time to fiddle around with
Eclipse, they were mistyping commands in the terminal and generally not paying enough
attention to instructions. This caused the exercises to go slowly.</p>
<p>We've had an exercise which asks the student to write a new test for a non-existing
method. Then implement the method and make sure all the tests passed. You guessed it
this is Test Driven Development.
IIRC one of the students was having a hard time with that exercise so I popped up
my editor on the large screen and started typing what she told me, then re-running the
tests and asking her to show me the errors I've made and tell me how to correct them.
The exercise was received very well and was fun to do.</p>
<p>Due to lack of time we had to go over TravisCI very quickly. The other bad thing about
TravisCI is that it requires git/GitHub and the students were generally inexperienced
with that. Both GitHub for Windows and Mac OS suck a big time IMO. What you need is the
console. However none of the students had any practical experience with git and knew
how to commit code and push branches to GitHub. git fundamentals however is a separate
one or two lessons by itself which we didn't do.</p>
<h2>Lesson 07 - Writing JUnit tests for Apache Commons</h2>
<p>Excluding the problems with Eclipse and the GitHub desktop client and
missing instructions for Windows the hardest part of this lesson was actually
selecting a component to work on, understanding what the code does and actually
writing meaningful tests. On top of that most students were not very proficient
programmers and Java was completely new to them.</p>
<p>Despite having 3 pull requests on GitHub I consider this lesson to be a failure.</p>
<h2>Lesson 08 - Integration Testing with Selenium</h2>
<p>This lesson starts with an example of what a flaky test it. At the moment I don't
think this lesson is the best place for that example. To make things even more difficult
the example is in Python (because that way was the easiest for me to write it) instead
of Java. Students had problems installing Python on Windows just to make this example work.
They also were lacking the knowledge how to execute a script in the terminal.</p>
<p>One of the students proposed a better flaky example utilizing dates and times and
executing it during various hours of the day. I have yet to code this and
prepare environment in which it would be executed. Btw recently I've seen similar behavior
caused by inconsistent timezone usage in Ruby which resulted in unexpected time offset
a little after midnight :).</p>
<p>Once again I have to point out that students came generally unprepared for the lesson
and haven't installed prerequisite software and programming languages. This is becoming
a trend and needs to be split out into a preparation session, possibly with a check
list.</p>
<p>On the Selenium side, starting with Selenium IDE, it was a bit unclear how to use it
and what needs to be done. This is another negative trend, where students were missing clear
instructions what they are expected to do. At the end we did resort to live demo
using Selenium IDE so they can at least get some idea about it.</p>
<h2>Lesson 09 and 10 - Writing Selenium tests for Mozilla Add-ons website</h2>
<p>IMO these two lessons are the biggest disaster of the entire course. Python &amp; virtualenv
on Windows was a total no go but on Linux things weren't much easier because students
had no idea what a virtualenv is.</p>
<p>Practice wise they haven't managed to read all the bugs on the Mozilla bug tracker and
had a very hard time selecting bugs to write tests for. Not to mention that many of the
reported bugs were administrative tasks to create or remove add-on categories. There
weren't many functional related bugs to write tests for.</p>
<p>The product under test was also hard to understand and most students were seeing it for the first
time, let alone getting to know the devel and testing environments that Mozilla provides.
Mozilla's test suite being in Python is just another issue to make contribution harder
because we've never actually studied Python.</p>
<p>Between the two lessons there were students who've missed the Selenium introduction
lesson and were having even harder time to figure things out. I didn't have the time
to explain and go back to the previous lesson for them.
Maybe an attendance policy is needed for dependent lessons.</p>
<p>Before the course started I've talked to some guys at Mozilla's IRC channel and
they agreed to help but at the end we didn't even engage with them. At this point
I'm skeptical that mentoring over IRC would have worked anyway.</p>
<h2>Lesson 11 - Introduction to Performance Testing</h2>
<p>This was a more theoretical lesson with less practical examples and exercises.
I have provided some blog posts of mine related to the topic of performance
testing but in general they are related to software that I've used which isn't
generally known to a less experienced audience (Celery, Twisted). These blog posts
IMO were hard to put into perspective and didn't serve a good purpose as examples.</p>
<p>The practical part of the lesson was a discussion with the goal of creating a
performance testing strategy for GitHub's infrastructure. It was me who was
doing most of the talking because students have no experience working on such
a large infrastructure like GitHub and didn't know what components might be
there, how they might be organized (load balancers, fail overs, etc)
and what needs to be tested.</p>
<p>There was also a more practical example to create a performance test in Java for
one of the classes found in <code>commons-codec/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/digest</code>.
Again the main difficulty here was working fluently with Eclipse, getting the projects to
build/run and knowing how the software under test was supposed to work and be executed.</p>
<h2>Lesson 12 - How to find 1000 bugs in 30 minutes</h2>
<p>This was a more relaxed lesson with examples of simple types of bugs found on a
large scale. Most examples came from my blog and experiments I've made against
Fedora.</p>
<p>While amusing and fun I don't think all of the students understood me and kept
their attention. Part of that is because Fedora tends to focus on low level
stuff and my examples were not necessarily easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Feedback from the sponsor</h2>
<p>Experian Bulgaria was the exclusive sponsor for this course. At the end of the summer
Rado and I met with them to discuss the results of the training. Here's what they say</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall technical knowledge they consider to be weak. What they need are people
with basic knowledge in the field of object oriented programming, databases, operating
systems and networking. These are skills candidates need in order to work for Experian.
It must be noted that most of them were not taught at this course!</li>
<li>English language proficiency for all students is low on average;</li>
<li>User level experience with Linux was fine but students were missing deeper
knowledge about the operating system. Once again something we didn't teach;</li>
<li>The programming languages favored at Experian are Java and Ruby and students
had poor knowledge of them. They also had weak understanding of OOP principles;</li>
<li>According to Experian students were more ingrained with the development mindset
and were trying their luck in the QA profession instead of genuinely being interested
in the field. While this is generally the case I have to point out that as sponsor
Experian did a poor job at promoting their company and the QA profession
as a whole. What isn't known to the general public is their big in-house
QA community which could have served as a source of inspiration for the students!</li>
<li>Low motivation and lack of fundamental knowledge from university are other
traits interviewers at Experian have identified. They argued for a stronger
acceptance process and a requirement of minimum 2 years of university
education in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the topic of testing knowledge candidates did mostly OK, however
we don't have enough information about this. Also the hiring process at
Experian is more focused on the broader knowledge areas listed above so
substantial improvement in the testing knowledge of candidates doesn't given
them much head start.</p>
<p>While to my knowledge they didn't hire anyone few people
received an offer but declined due to various personal reasons. I view this
as poor performance on our side but Experian thinks otherwise and are willing
to sponsor another round of training.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here is a list of all the things that could be improved</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time to develop the curriculum and have it pass QA review by other
experienced testers (in particular such that also teach students);</li>
<li>Make the application process harder to include people with broader IT knowledge;</li>
<li>Allow time to review all applicants;</li>
<li>Find a co-trainer and additional mentors for some of the exercises;</li>
<li>Minimize the number of students accepted in the course so we can handle everyone
with more care;</li>
<li>Give homework assignments and examine them before each lesson;</li>
<li>Collect and provide performance review at the end of the course;</li>
<li>Minimize the technology stack and tools used;</li>
<li>Host a technology preparation session at the beginning paired
with a check list of all the things that need to be done. Very likely
make the chosen technology stack a hard requirement to avoid setbacks
later in the schedule;</li>
<li>We need more fundamental lessons like practical git tutorial,
practical Linux tutorial, databases, networking, etc.</li>
<li>Same goes for Java or any other programming language. Each of these technologies
easily makes a course by itself. Possibly include technology skill assessment
in the application form and reject candidates who don't meet the minimum level.
This is to ensure the group is able to move at the same pace.</li>
<li>We need to improve the infrastructure used during the course,
especially exercise bug tracking and test case management systems;</li>
<li>Students need clear instructions for every exercise - what is required from them,
what the expected result is and what they need to be doing, etc;</li>
<li>Provide more examples for just about everything. Also make the examples
easier to understand/simple with the harder examples left for further
reading;</li>
<li>Provide easier projects to work on. This means applications whose domain
is easier to understand and closer to what experiences the students might have.
Also projects need clear instructions how to join and how to contribute with tests.</li>
<li>The same application/software needs to be used for manual bug finding,
unit test writing and integration test with Selenium. This will minimize
both context and technology switches and allow to view various testing
activities in the context of a single software under test;</li>
<li>While using open source projects for the above listed purposes sounds great
the reality is that they are hard to join and will not move according to our
schedule. Maybe less focus on open source per-se and more focus on a particular
application under test. Instructors can then proxy all the tests forward
to the upstream community;</li>
<li>Focus more on practice and less on exotic topics like performance testing
and large scale bug finding;</li>
<li>Seek more active participation from sponsors!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions please comment below, especially if you can tell me
how to implement them in practice.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                <div class="highlight"><pre>Every activity in software development has a cost and a value. Getting cost to
trend down while increasing value, is the ultimate goal.
</pre></div>


<p>This is the introduction of an e-book called
<a href="http://pi.qasymphony.com/four-quick-wins-thank-you">4 Quick Wins to Manage the Cost of Software Testing</a>.
It was sent to me by Ivan Fingarov couple of months ago. Just now I've managed to
read it and here's a quick summary. I urge everyone to download the original copy
and give it a read.</p>
<p>The paper focuses on several practices which organizations can apply immediately
in order to become more efficient and transparent in their software testing. While
larger organizations (e.g. enterprises) have most of these practices already in place
smaller companies (up to 50-100 engineering staff) may not be familiar with them
and will reap the most benefits of implementing said practices. Even though I work
for a large enterprise I find this guide useful when considered at the individual
team level!</p>
<p>The first chapter focuses on <em>Tactics</em> to minimize cost: Process, Tools, Bug System Mining
and Eliminating Handoffs.</p>
<p>In <em>Process</em> the goal is to minimize the burden of documenting the test process
(aka testing artifacts), allow for better transparency and visibility outside the QA group
and streamline the decision making process of what to test and when to stop testing,
how much has been tested, what the risk is, ect. The authors propose testing core functionality
paired with emerging risk areas based on new features development. They propose making
a list of these and sorting that list by perceived risk/priority and testing as much
as possible. Indeed this is very similar to the method I've used at Red Hat when designing
testing for new features and new major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. A similar
method I've seen in place at several start-ups as well, although in the small organization
the primary driver for this method is lack of sufficient test resources.</p>
<p><em>Tools</em> proposes the use of test case management systems to ease the documentation burden.
I've used <a href="http://testlink.org/">TestLink</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate">Nitrate</a>.
From them Nitrate has more features but is currently unmaintained with me being the
largest contributor on GitHub. From the paid variants I've used
<a href="https://www.polarion.com/products/qa/test-automation">Polarion</a> which I generally dislike.
Polarion is most suitable for large organizations because it gives lots of opportunities
for tracking and reporting. For small organizations it is an overkill.</p>
<p><em>Bug System Mining</em> is a technique which involves regularly scanning the bug tracker
and searching for patterns. This is useful for finding bug types which appear
frequently and generally point to a flaw in the software development process. The fix for these
flaws usually is a change in policy/workflow which eliminates the source of the errors.
I'm a fan of this technique when joining an existing project and need to assess
what the current state is. I've done this when consulting for a few start-ups, including
<a href="http://meet.jit.si">Jitsi Meet</a> (acquired by Atlassian), however I'm not doing bug mining
on a regular basis which I consider a drawback and I really should start doing!</p>
<p>For example at one project I found lots of bugs reported against translations, e.g.
missing translations, text overflowing the visible screen area or not playing well with
existing design, chosen language/style not fitting well with the product domain, etc.</p>
<p>The root cause of the problem was how the software in question has been localized.
The translators were given a file of English strings, which they would translate and
return back in an spread sheet. Developers would copy&amp;paste the translated strings
into localization files and integrate with the software. Then QA would usually
inspect all the pages and report the above issues. The solution was to remove devel
and QA from the translation process, implement a translation management system together
with live preview (web based) so that translators can keep track of what is left to
translate and can visually inspect their work immediately after a string was translated.
Thus translators are given more context for their work but also given the responsibility
to produce good quality translations.</p>
<p>Another example I've seen are many bugs which seem like a follow up/nice to have features
of partially implemented functionality. The root cause of this problem turned out to be
that devel was jumping straight to implementation without taking the time to brainstorm
and consult with QE and product owners, not taking into account corner cases and minor
issues which would have easily been raised by skillful testers. This process lead to
several iterations until the said functionality was considered initially implemented.</p>
<p><em>Eliminating Handoffs</em> proposes the use of cross-functional teams to reduce idle time
and reduce the back-and-forth communication which happens when a bug is found, reported,
evaluated and considered for a fix, fixed by devel and finally deployed for testing.
This method argues that including testers early in the process and pairing them with
the devel team will produce faster bug fixes and reduce communication burden.</p>
<p>While I generally agree with that statement it's worth noting that cross-functional
teams perform really well when all team members have relatively equal skill level
on the horizontal scale and strong experience on the vertical scale (think T-shaped specialist).
Cross-functional teams
don't work well when you have developers who aren't well versed in the testing domain
and/or testers who are not well versed in programming or the broader OS/computer science
fundamentals domain. In my opinion you need well experienced engineers for a good cross-functional
team.</p>
<p>In the chapter <em>Collaboration</em> the paper focuses on pairing, building the right thing
and faster feedback loops for developers. This overlaps with earlier proposals for
cross-functional teams and QA bringing value by asking the "what if" questions.
The chapter specifically talks about the Three Amigos meeting between PM, devel and QA
where they discuss a feature proposal from all angles and finally come to a conclusion
what the feature should look like. I'm a strong supporter of this technique and have
been working with it under one form or another during my entire career. This also
touches on the notion that testers need to move into the <em>Quality Assistance</em> business
and be proactive during the software development process, which is something I'm
hoping to talk about at the
<a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro/">Romanian Testing Conference</a> next year!</p>
<p>Finally the book talks about <em>Skills Development</em> and makes the distinction between
Centers of Excellence (CoE) and Communities of Practice (CoP). Both the book and I
are supporters of the CoP approach. This is a bottoms-up approach which is open for
everyone to join in and harnesses the team creative abilities. It also takes into
account that different teams use different methods and tools and that
"one size doesn't fit all"!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Skilled teams find important bugs faster, discover innovative solutions to hard
testing problems and know how to communicate their value. Sometimes, a few super
testers can replace an army of average testers.
</pre></div>


<p>While I consider myself to be a "super tester" with thousands of bugs reported there
is a very important note to make here. Communities of Practice are successful when
their members are self-focused on skill development! In my view and to some
extent the communities I've worked with everyone should strive to constantly improve
their skills but also exercise peer pressure on their co-workers to not fall behind.
This has been confirmed by other folks in the QA industry and I've heard it many times
when talking to friends from other companies.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    Mutation Testing vs. Coverage
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>At GTAC 2015 Laura Inozemtseva made a lightning talk titled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=47">Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness</a>
which is the single event that got me hooked up with mutation testing.
This year, at GTAC 2016, Rahul Gopinath made a counter argument
with his lightning talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEptA3KP08&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=1">Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test Suite Effectiveness</a>.
So which one is better ? I urge you to watch both talks and take notes before
reading about my practical experiment and other opinions on the topic!</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic-Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python
so my view is biased!</p>
<p>Both Laura and Rahul (you will too) agree that a test suite effectiveness depends
on the strength of its oracles. In other words the assertions you make in your tests.
This is what makes a test suite good and determines its ability to detect bugs when
present. I've decided to use <a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab">pelican-ab</a> as
a practical example. pelican-ab is a plugin for Pelican, the static site generator
for Python. It allows you to generate A/B experiments by writing out the content
into different directories and adjusting URL paths based on the experiment name.</p>
<h2>Can 100% code coverage detect bugs</h2>
<p>Absolutely <strong>NOT</strong>! In version 0.2.1,
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ef1e2117ad8ffa5b9fa8470d32d54a36ccb140bb">commit ef1e211</a>,

<p>This is because before each invocation Pelican deletes the output directory and
re-creates the entire content structure. The bug was not caught regardless of
having 100% line + branch coverage. See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/129514715">Build #10</a> for more
info.</p>
<h2>Can 100% mutation coverage detect bugs</h2>
<p>So I've branched off since commit ef1e211 into the
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commits/mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment">mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment branch</a>
(requires Pelican==3.6.3).</p>
<p>After initial execution of Cosmic Ray I have 2 mutants left:</p>

<p>The last one, job 33 is equivalent mutation. The first one, job 29 is killed by the test
added in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/b8bff85eeca6c18fbf62cac55fd1a0d64295c43c">commit b8bff85</a>.
For all practical purposes we now have 100% code coverage and 100% mutation coverage.
The bug described above still exists thought.</p>
<h2>How can we detect the bug</h2>
<p>The bug isn't detected by any test because
we don't have tests designed to perform and validate the exact same steps that a
physical person will execute when using pelican-ab. Such test is added in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ca85bd042d783f2f6551ae17f16b29aa3750711b">commit ca85bd0</a>
and you can see that it causes
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/186510356">Build #22</a> to fail.</p>
<p>Experiment with setting <code>DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=False</code> in <code>tests/pelicanconf.py</code> and
the test will PASS!</p>
<h2>Is pelican-ab bug free</h2>
<p>Not of course. Even after 100% code and mutation coverage and after manually constructing
a test which mimics user behavior there is at least one more bug present. There
is a pylint <code>bad-super-call</code> error, fixed in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/193e3db9e7d021e11b54f54ac8b8718651c633c8">commit 193e3db</a>.
For more information about the error see
<a href="http://mrsenko.com/blog/atodorov/2016/09/14/beware-of-recursion-loop-when-using-super/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Other bugs found</h2>
<p>During my humble experience with mutation testing so far I've added
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pulls/atodorov">quite a few new tests</a>
and discovered two bugs which went unnoticed for years. The first one is
constructor parameter not passed to parent constructor,
see
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-f4294048719aeac4da7a86eee0fbdfd3">PR#96, pykickstart/commands/authconfig.py</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>     def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):
<span class="gd">-        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</span>
<span class="gi">+        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)</span>
         self.authconfig = kwargs.get(&quot;authconfig&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>The second bug is parameter being passed to parent class constructor,
but the parent class doesn't care about this parameter. For example
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-7d2833450b6e1c9a94eb90e7f171ff52">PR#96, pykickstart/commands/driverdisk.py</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gd">-    def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):</span>
<span class="gd">-        BaseData.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)</span>
<span class="gi">+    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):</span>
<span class="gi">+        BaseData.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Also note that pykickstart has nearly 100% test coverage as a whole
and the affected files were 100% covered as well.</p>
<p>The bugs above don't seem like a big deal and when considered out of context
are relatively minor. However pykickstart's biggest client is anaconda, the Fedora
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program. Anaconda uses pykickstart to
parse and generate text files (called kickstart files) which contain information
for driving the installation in a fully automated manner. This is used by everyone
who installs Linux on a large scale and is pretty important functionality!</p>
<p><code>writePriority</code> controls the order of which individual commands are written to file
at the end of the installation. In rare cases the order of commands may depend
on each other. Now imagine the bugs above produce a disordered kickstart file,
which a system administrator thinks should work but it doesn't. It may be the case
this administrator is trying to provision hundreds of Linux systems to bootstrap
a new data center or maybe performing disaster recovery. You get the scale of
the problem now, don't you?</p>
<p>To be honest I've seen bugs of this nature but not in the last several years.</p>
<p>This is all to say a minor change like this may have
an unexpectedly big impact somewhere down the line.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With respect to the above findings and my bias I'll say the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither 100% coverage, nor 100% mutation coverage are a silver bullet against bugs;</li>
<li>100% mutation coverage appears to be better than 100% code coverage in practice;</li>
<li>Mutation testing clearly shows out pieces of code which need refactoring
  which in turn minimizes the number of possible mutations;</li>
<li>Mutation testing causes you to write more asserts and construct more detailed tests
  which is always a good thing when testing software;</li>
<li>You can't replace humans designing test cases just yet but can give them tools
  to allow them to write more and better tests;</li>
<li>You should not rely on a single tool (or two of them) because tools are only
  able to find bugs they were designed for!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus: What others think</h2>
<p>As a bonus to this article let me share a transcript from the
<a href="https://mutation-testing.slack.com">mutation-testing.slack.com</a> community:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>atodorov 2:28 PM
Hello everyone, I&#39;d like to kick-off a discussion / interested in what you think about
Rahul Gopinath&#39;s talk at GTAC this year. What he argues is that test coverage is still
the best metric for how good a test suite is and that mutation coverage doesn&#39;t add much
additional value. His talk is basically the opposite of what @lminozem presented last year
at GTAC. Obviously the community here and especially tools authors will have an opinion on
these two presentations.

tjchambers 12:37 AM
@atodorov I have had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of working on a couple projects lately that illustrate
why LOC test coverage is a misnomer. I am a **strong** proponent of mutation testing so will
declare my bias.

The projects I have worked on have had a mix of test coverage - one about 50% and
another &gt; 90%.

In both cases however there was a significant difference IMO relative to mutation coverage
(which I have more faith in as representative of true tested code).

Critical factors I see when I look at the difference:

- Line length: in both projects the line lengths FAR exceeded visible line lengths that are
&quot;acceptable&quot;. Many LONGER lines had inline conditionals at the end, or had ternary operators
and therefore were in fact only 50% or not at all covered, but were &quot;traversed&quot;

- Code Conviction (my term): Most of the code in these projects (Rails applications) had
significant Hash references all of which were declared in &quot;traditional&quot; format hhh[:symbol].
So it was nearly impossible for the code in execution to confirm the expectation of the
existence of a hash entry as would be the case with stronger code such as &quot;hhh.fetch(:symbol)&quot;

- Instance variables abound: As with most of Rails code the number of instance variables
in a controller are extreme. This pattern of reference leaked into all other code as well,
making it nearly impossible with the complex code flow to ascertain proper reference
patterns that ensured the use of the instance variables, so there were numerous cases
of instance variable typos that went unnoticed for years. (edited)

- .save and .update: yes again a Rails issue, but use of these &quot;weak&quot; operations showed again
that although they were traversed, in many cases those method references could be removed
during mutation and the tests would still pass - a clear indication that save or update was
silently failing.

I could go on and on, but the mere traversal of a line of code in Ruby is far from an indication
of anything more than it may be &quot;typed in correctly&quot;.

@atodorov Hope that helps.

LOC test coverage is a place to begin - NOT a place to end.

atodorov 1:01 AM
@tjchambers: thanks for your answer. It&#39;s too late for me here to read it carefully but
I&#39;ll do it tomorrow and ping you back

dkubb 1:13 AM
As a practice mutation testing is less widely used. The tooling is still maturing. Depending on your
language and environment you might have widely different experiences with mutation testing

I have not watched the video, but it is conceivable that someone could try out mutation testing tools
for their language and conclude it doesn’t add very much

mbj 1:14 AM
Yeah, I recall talking with @lminozem here and we identified that the tools she used likely
show high rates of false positives / false coverage (as the tools likely do not protect against
certain types of integration errors)

dkubb 1:15 AM
IME, having done TDD for about 15+ years or so, and mutation testing for about 6 years, I think
when it is done well it can be far superior to using line coverage as a measurement of test quality

mbj 1:16 AM
Any talk pro/against mutation testing must, as the tool basis is not very homogeneous, show a non consistent result.

dkubb 1:16 AM
Like @tjchambers says though, if you have really poor line coverage you’re not going to
get as much of a benefit from mutation testing, since it’s going to be telling you what
you already know — that your project is poorly tested and lots of code is never exercised

mbj 1:19 AM
Thats a good and likely the core point. I consider that mutation testing only makes sense
when aiming for 100% (and this is to my experience not impractical).

tjchambers 1:20 AM
I don&#39;t discount the fact that tool quality in any endeavor can bring pro/con judgements
based on particular outcomes

dkubb 1:20 AM
What is really interesting for people is to get to 100% line coverage, and then try mutation
testing. You think you’ve done a good job, but I guarantee mutation testing will find dozens
if not hundreds of untested cases .. even in something with 100% line coverage

To properly evaluate mutation testing, I think this process is required, because you can’t
truly understand how little line coverage gives you in comparison

tjchambers 1:22 AM
But I don&#39;t need a tool to tell me that a 250 character line of conditional code that by
itself would be an oversized method AND counts more because there are fewer lines in the
overall percentage contributes to a very foggy sense of coverage.

dkubb 1:22 AM
It would not be unusual for something with 100% line coverage to undergo mutation testing
and actually find out that the tests only kill 60-70% of possible mutations

tjchambers 1:22 AM
@dkubb or less

dkubb 1:23 AM
usually much less :stuck_out_tongue:

it can be really humbling

mbj 1:23 AM
In this discussion you miss that many test suites (unless you have noop detection):
Will show false coverage.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
When I started with mutant on my own project which I developed I had 95% LOC coverage

mbj 1:23 AM
Test suites need to be fixed to comply to mutation testing invariants.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
I had 34% mutation coverage

And that was ignoring the 5% that wasn&#39;t covered at all

mbj 1:24 AM
Also if the tool you compare MT with line coverage on: Is not very strong,
the improvement may not be visible.

dkubb 1:24 AM
another nice benefit is that you will become much better at enumerating all
the things you need to do when writing tests

tjchambers 1:24 AM
@dkubb or better yet - when writing code.

The way I look at it - the fewer the alive mutations the better the test,
the fewer the mutations the better the code.

dkubb 1:29 AM
yeah, you can infer a kind of cyclomatic complexity by looking at how many mutations there are

tjchambers 1:31 AM
Even without tests (not recommended) you can judge a lot from the mutations themselves.

I still am an advocate for mutations/LOC metric
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see members in the community are strong supporters of mutation testing, all of them
having much more experience than I do.</p>
<p>Please help me collect more practical examples! My goal is to
collect enough information and present the findings at
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/">GTAC 2017</a>
which will be held in London.</p>

<p>In Travis-CI when you combine the three main configuration options of
<em>Runtime (language)</em>, <em>Environment</em> and <em>Exclusions/Inclusions</em> you get a
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Build-Matrix">build matrix</a>
of all possible combinations! For example, for <em>django-chartit</em> the matrix includes
43 build jobs, spread across various Python and Django versions. For reference
see <a href="https://travis-ci.org/chartit/django-chartit/builds/181115880">Build #75</a>.</p>
<p>For <em>django-chartit</em> I wanted to have an additional build job which would execute
pylint. I wanted the job to be independent because currently pylint produces lots
of errors and warnings. Having an independent job instead of integrating pylint
together with all jobs makes it easier to see if any of the functional tests failed.</p>
<p>Using the inclusion functionality of Travis-CI I was able to define an auxiliary
build job. The trick is to provide sane environment defaults for all
build jobs (regular and auxiliary ones) so you don't have to expand your environment
section! In this case the change looks like this</p>

his RSpec test suites. He was able to consistently reproduce a segfault which
looked like this:</p>

<p>Googling for <code>vm_call_cfunc - cfp consistency error</code> yields
<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10460">Ruby #10460</a>. Comments on the bug and
particularly this one point towards the error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; Ruby is trying to be nice about reporting the error; but in the end,
&gt; your code is still broken if it overflows stack.
</pre></div>


<p>Somewhere in the test suite was a piece of code that was overflowing the stack.
It was somewhere along the lines of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;#active_client_for_user&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">context</span> <span class="s1">&#39;matching an existing user&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">it_behaves_like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;manager authentication&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">include_examples</span> <span class="s1">&#39;active client for user with existing user&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Considering the examples in the bug I started looking for patterns where a variable
was defined and later redefined, possibly circling back to the previous definition.
Expanding the shared examples by hand transformed the code into</p>

<p>Line 5. overrode line 3. When line 4. was executed first because of lazy execution
and the call execution path became: 4-5-4-5-4-5 ... <strong>NOTE:</strong> I think we need a
warning about that in RuboCop, see
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/3769">RuboCop #3769</a>.
The fix however is a no brainer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gd">-  let(:user) { create(:user, :manager) }</span>
<span class="gd">-  let!(:api_user_authentication) { create(:user_authentication, user: user) }</span>

                <p><img alt="ISTA 2016" src="/images/ista2016.jpg" title="ISTA 2016" /></p>
<p>Another two weeks have passed and I'm blogging about another 2 conferences.
This year both
<a href="https://istacon.org/">Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2016/">Google Test Automation Conference</a>
happened on the same day. I was attending ISTA in Sofia during the day and
watching the live stream of GTAC during the evenings. Here are some of the things
that reflected on me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I build my software in order to make this a perfect day for the user ?</li>
<li>People are not the problem which causes bad software to exist. When designing
software focus on what people need not on what technology is forcing them to do;</li>
<li>You need to have blind trust in the people you work with because all the times
projects look like they are not going to work until the very end!</li>
<li>It's good to have diverse set of characters in the company and not homogenize people;</li>
<li>Team performance grows over time. Effective teams minimize time waste
during bad periods. They (have and) extract value from conflicts!</li>
<li>One-on-one meetings are usually like status reports which is bad. Both parties
should bring their own issues to the table;</li>
<li>To grow an effective team members need to do things together. For example
pair programming, writing test scenarios, etc;</li>
<li>When teams don't take actions after retrospective meetings it is usually a 
sign of missing foundational trust;</li>
<li>QA engineers need to be present at every step of the software development
life-cycle! This is something I teach my students and have been confirmed by
many friends in the industry;</li>
<li>Agile is all about data, even when it comes to testing and quality. We need to
decompose and measure iteratively;</li>
<li>Agile is also about really skillful people. One way to boost your skills is to
adopt the T-shaped specialist model;</li>
<li>In agile iterative work and continuous delivery is king so QA engineers need to focus
even more on visualization (I will also add documentation), refactoring and code reviews;</li>
<li>Agile teams need to give opportunities to team members for taking risk and taking
ownership of their actions in the gray zone (e.g. actions which isn't clear who should
be doing).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the brave new world of micro services end to end testing is no more! We test each level
in isolation but keep stable contracts/APIs between levels. That way we can reduce
the test burden and still guarantee an acceptable level of risk. This change in
software architecture (monolithic vs. micro) leads to change in technologies (one framework/language
vs. what's best for the task) which in turn leads to changes in testing approach and
testing tools. This ultimately leads to changing people on the team because they now
need different skills than when they were hired! This circles back to the T-shaped
specialist model and the fact that QA should be integrated in every step of the way!
Thanks to Denitsa Evtimova and Lyudmila Labova for this wisdom and the quote pictured
above.</p>
<p>Aneta Petkova talked about monitoring of test results which is a topic very close to my work.
Imagine you have your automated test suite but still get failures occasionally. Are these
bugs or something else broke ? If they are bugs and you are waiting for them to be fixed
do you execute the tests against the still broken build or wait ? If you do, what additional info
do you get from these executions vs. how much time do you spend figuring out
"oh, that's still not fixed or geez, here's another hidden bug in the code" ?</p>
<p>Her team has modified their test execution framework (what I'd usually call a test runner
or even test lab) to have knowledge about issues in JIRA and skip some tests
when no meaningful information can be extracted from them. I have to point out that this
approach may require a lot of maintenance in environments where you have failures due to
infrastructure issues. This idea connects very nicely
with the general idea behind this year's GTAC - don't run tests if you don't need to aka
smart test execution!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=2h54m0s">Boris Prikhodskiy</a>
shared a very simple rule. Don't execute tests</p>
<ul>
<li>which have 100 % pass rate;</li>
<li>during the last month;</li>
<li>and have been executed at least 100 times before that!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Unity does for their numerous topic branches and reduces test time
with 60-70 percent. All of the test suite is still executed against their trunk branch
and PR merge queue branches!</p>
<p>At GTAC there were several presentations about speeding up test execution time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=3h18m25s">Emanuil Slavov</a> was very practical
but the most important thing he said was that a fast test suite is the result of many
conscious actions which introduced small improvements over time. His team had assigned
themselves the task to iteratively improve their test suite performance and at every step
of the way they analyzed the existing bottlenecks and experimented with possible solutions.</p>
<p>The steps in particular are (on a single machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute tests in dedicated environment;</li>
<li>Start with empty database, not used by anything else; This also leads to
adjustments in your test suite architecture and DB setup procedures;</li>
<li>Simulate and stub external dependencies like 3rd party services;</li>
<li>Move to containers but beware of slow disk I/O;</li>
<li>Run database in memory not on disk because it is a temporary DB anyway;</li>
<li>Don't clean test data, just trash the entire DB once you're done;</li>
<li>Execute tests in parallel which should be the last thing to do!</li>
<li>Equalize workload between parallel threads for optimal performance;</li>
<li>Upgrade the hardware (RAM, CPU) aka vertical scaling;</li>
<li>Add horizontal scaling (probably with a messaging layer);</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=6h38m7s">John Micco and Atif Memon</a>
talked about flaky tests at Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of the transitions from PASS to FAIL are flakes;</li>
<li>Almost 16% of their 3.5 million tests have some level of flakiness;</li>
<li>Flaky failures frequently block and delay releases;</li>
<li>Google spends between 2% and 16% of their CI compute resources
re-running flaky tests;</li>
<li>Flakiness insertion speed is comparable to flakiness removal speed!</li>
<li>The optimal setting is 2 persons modifying the same source file at the same time.
This leads to minimal chance of breaking stuff;</li>
<li>Fix or delete flaky tests because you don't get meaningful value out of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Google want to stop a test execution before it is executed if historical
data shows that the test has attributes of flakiness. The research they talk
about utilizes tons of data collected from Google's CI environment which was
the most interesting fact for me. Indeed if we use data to decide which features
to build for our customers then why not use data to govern the process of testing?
In addition to the video you should read John's post
<a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/05/flaky-tests-at-google-and-how-we.html">Flaky Tests at Google and How We Mitigate Them</a>.</p>
<p>At the end I'd like to finish with 
Rahul Gopinath's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=4h57m30s">Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test suite Effectiveness in the Real World</a>.
He basically said that code coverage metrics as we know them today are still
the best practical indicator of how good a test suite is. He argues that mutation testing is slow
and only provides additional 4% to a well designed test suite. This is absolutely the opposite of
what Laura Inozemtseva presented last year in her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;list=PLSIUOFhnxEiCWGsN9t5A-XOhRbmz54IS1&amp;index=25">Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness</a>
lightning talk. Rahul also made a point about sample size in the two research papers
and I had the impression he's saying Laura didn't do a proper academic research.</p>
<p>I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python and also use
mutation testing in my daily job so this is a very interesting topic indeed. I've asked
fellow tool authors to have a look at both presentations and share their opinions.
I also have an idea about a practical experiment to see if full branch coverage and
full mutation coverage will be able to find a known bug in a piece of software
I wrote. I will be writing about this experiment next week so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    IT Weekend Highlights
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend_cake.jpg" title="IT Weekend" /></p>
<p>Last weekend I attended the third <a href="http://it-weekend.com">IT Weekend</a>.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. While during the
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/">first week</a> the crowd was more in
the junior to mid level range now the crowd was more into the senior level range
which made for better talks and discussions. The most interesting sessions
for me were <em>On-boarding of New Team Members</em> by Nikola Naidenov and
<em>Agile Leadership</em> by Bogoi Bogdanov. Here are some of the highlights
that I wrote down:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-boarding of new team members is very important. You need to have a plan for
their first 6 months at the company. This plan needs to have clearly defined tasks
and expectations;</li>
<li>When a person becomes productive for their team/company it means they have been
on-boarded successfully;</li>
<li>A company provided trainer is a good thing but they tend to focus on broader
knowledge, they don't cover team specific domain knowledge;</li>
<li>Some companies provide both technical and business trainers for their teams;</li>
<li>It is very important to get timely feedback when you are the one providing training.
However feedback isn't always easy to get and we don't always receive sincere feedback;</li>
<li>If the team is swamped with work tasks you need to provide 10-20% of the time
for learning and experimenting with new technologies. IMO this is best done by
filing tickets in your bug/task tracking system and prioritizing them together with
the rest of the tasks;</li>
<li>It is also important to have an individual training plan for each team member
and review this on a regular basis;</li>
<li>We should strive to use unified terminology and jargon as to not confuse
people. IMO it is usually the new hires who are likely to get confused because they
are not familiar with the history of the terms used;</li>
</ul>
<p>In an agile environment we calculate productivity using the formula</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Productivity = Effort * Competence * Environment * Motivation^2
</pre></div>


<p>There are 3 important factors that drive motivation</p>
<ul>
<li>to have a <strong>Purpose</strong></li>
<li>to feel <strong>Autonomy</strong></li>
<li>to be able to achieve <strong>Mastery</strong> in your skills</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to note that autonomy is not the opposite of alignment
as depicted by the image below.</p>
<p><img alt="Alignment and autonomy" src="/images/alignment_autonomy.jpg" title="alignment and autonomy" /></p>
<p>In agile environment control is a function of trust. To be able to trust people we
need to give them autonomy, transparency and short feedback loop!</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage for the normal treat exceptions as exceptional;</li>
<li>Failure recovery is more important than failure avoidance;</li>
<li>Fail fast means learning fast and improving fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">
                    Animate & Automate
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Recently I've attended a presentation by MentorMate where they talked about
testing CSS animations (
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxzzfFBR8o&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=6">video in Bulgarian</a>
). The software under test was an ad tech SDK which
provides CSS based animations to mobile apps and games. The content
is displayed inside a webview and they had to make sure animations were
working correctly on different OS and devices.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content (aka getting to know the domain) they figured out
in reality there were about 20 basic movements and transformations. So the
problem was reduced to "How do we test these 20 basic movements under
various OSes and devices" or "How do we verify that basic CSS transformations
are supported under different versions and flavors of the OS"?</p>
<p>Their test bed included hand crafted web pages with each basic movement
and then several ones with more complex animations (aka integration testing).
The idea was to load
these pages under different devices and inspect whether or not the animations
were visualized properly.</p>
<p>A test script (aka their testing framework) was constantly recording the
coordinates of the elements under test to verify that they were really animated.
The idea was to use a sample rate of 20ms and expect at lest 20 different changes
to the element under test. Coordinates along with color and gradient were recorded
and then returned back and analyzed to report a PASS or FAIL result.</p>
<p>This simplistic framework has limitations of course. It is not currently checking
the boundaries of where the elements are rendered on the screen. Thus if everything
else works as expected this will be a false positive result. On their slides
this can be seen at <a href="https://youtu.be/MIxzzfFBR8o?t=23m10s">23:10</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note the entire effort took about 2 days, including research and preparing
the test content.</p>
<p>I really like the back to basics approach here and the simplistic framework that
MentorMate came up with. Sure it misses some problems but for that particular case
it is good enough, easy and fast to implement.</p>

            </a>
                <p><img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend.png" title="IT Weekend" /></p>
<p>Last week I attended the first <a href="http://it-weekend.com">IT Weekend</a> in Bulgaria.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. There were 20 people
attending and the format was very friendly and relaxed. The group had members with
various levels of experience and technical skills, also different areas they work in.
All presentations are on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRA3tRwclRU&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=1">YouTube</a>.
Here's a brief of what happened and what I learned.</p>
<p>I had the honor to present in the first slot and gave a quick introduction
to mutation testing. This was my first time giving this talk and I'm not entirely
happy with how I've presented it. Also mutation testing is touching a lot on unit tests,
programming and source code which in some organizations goes to the devel department.
I think mutation testing is harder to understand from people not familiar with it
than I initially thought. I'm taking note to improve the way I present this topic
to the public.</p>
<p>Yavor Donev gave a good overview of Appium and how to use it on Android.
The most important question for me was "<em>Is it possible to utilize the same test suite
on Android and iOS, given that the environments are different</em>". With this I mean
regardless of how much we try to make the same (native) app on both platforms
it will end up differently because the platforms are essentially different. For
example there is a different number of physical buttons available.</p>
<p>If we assume that both iOS and Android apps follow the same design and use
similar workflow then it should be possible to create a test suite which is
platform aware and account for the minor differences. We're also adding
another layer of complexity by introducing the requirement that both apps stay
in sync with each other and account for the quirks of the foreign platform.
Depending on your apps and goals this may not be an easy task!</p>
<p>The one thing I didn't like about Appium is that upstream doesn't care much about
version compatibility and they tend to break and change stuff arbitrary between
releases. That said if it works, don't update it or otherwise be extremely
careful.</p>
<p>I also had a nice chat with Yavor on the topic of career change, learning to
program and working with people who have very little coding experience. His
approach is to develop a higher level test framework on top of Appium which
his team mates can use more easily.</p>
<p>Aneta Petkova's <em>Selenium Grid in Unix Environment</em> is a bit out of my domain.
However I took one important lesson: regardless of how great your tools are
there are minor details which can make or break your day. In her case these
are the physical location of the tests (e.g. which Selenium node runs them) and
access to shared resources. Turns out WebDriver doesn't give you
this information directly and you need to go through hoops to get it. Her
solution was to place the test code on the Grid Hub and provide a shared file system.</p>
<p>The bigger lesson is: whenever you have to design an automated test environment
(aka test lab) make sure to evaluate your needs beforehand.</p>
<p>The last talk was a guest appearance by Denitsa Evtimova. She is a QA architect
with 16 years of experience and presented the QA strategy at Paysafe group.
They have a large monolithic system (legacy code) and have adopted a pyramid
style approach to testing. Whenever possible tests are brought down to the lowest
level (e.g. unit tests) and not repeated on the higher levels. At the top
stand manual testing. Teams are small: 3-4 developers and 2-3 QAs. It is the team
responsibility to make sure tests are implemented at the lowest possible level.
The process is not strictly enforced and the company relies more on self
governance in this aspect. Also everyone on the team can contribute
additional tests whenever they see something missing.
Test (writing) tasks are all logged in JIRA. They are also small so that
everything can be completed in the same day.</p>
<p>The second day was more informal. We did a quick exploratory testing
exercise and shared opinions on different test tools. Then the group had
a discussion about soft skills and how QA engineers can change the perception
of developers about the QA profession (especially in teams where there are many
manual testers). The key points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criticize the software, not the person, e.g. don't blame the person directly;</li>
<li>Communicate with concrete facts and data, not emotions and perceptions;</li>
<li>Jokes of the type "how many QA engineers are needed to screw a light bulb"
are a problem because they lead to underestimation of the job role;</li>
<li>Sometimes it is not quite clear (to others) how the QA role contributes to
the development of the product and the organization;</li>
<li>For a QA it is important to be able to give a non-biased opinion and
observations on what is happening with the product/process;</li>
<li>A QA person needs to be very calm. They have to be able to listen to
everybody (especially developers) and accept their point of view but at
the same time also communicate their own point of view.</li>
<li>It is important
to sit together with developers and observe the problem, brainstorm and
propose possible solutions. This also creates a feedback loop where the
developer feels empowered because he's part of the process identifying
the problem and proposing the best solution;</li>
<li>In agile teams it is a good idea to rotate people between developer and
QA positions. This will help them better understand the job of others,
acquire new skills and also bring fresh thinking to the team;</li>
<li>Quality Assurance is an ungrateful job and only people with very calm and methodical
thinking (to follow through and write all possible scenarios) are able to excel
in this field. On the other hand developer usually think about the happy path
scenarios and strive to make their code work as best as they can;</li>
<li>By rotating job roles within the team developers
will quickly find out that testing is not their field and gain respect
towards their QA peers;</li>
<li>US managers have the habit of telling "good job" to everyone, even for
small and routine tasks. In Bulgaria (and maybe elsewhere) we're not used
to this. Instead we're used of being scolded when we do something wrong.
If everything is good then we don't receive any recognition;</li>
<li>Using the American "good job" is actually a good thing. Team mates will
start performing better over time because they will feel their work is
valued and not meaningless, they will feel recognized which will boost
morale and productivity.</li>
</ul>

Python 3 has simplified the

<p>The problem is that the second elements in both lists have different keys
and Python doesn't know how to compare them. In earlier Python versions
this has been special cased as
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3484293/is-there-a-description-of-how-cmp-works-for-dict-objects-in-python-2/3484456#3484456">described here</a>
by Ned Batchelder (the author of Python's coverage tool) but in Python 3
dictionaries have no natural sort order.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>django-chartit</em> (of which I'm now the official maintainer) this
bug triggers when you want to plot data from multiple sources (models) on the same
chart. In this case the fields coming from each data series are different and the
above error is triggered.</p>
<p>I have worked around this in
<a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit/commit/9d9033ecd5a8592a12872293cdf6d710cebf894f">commit 9d9033e</a>
by simply disabling an iterator sort but this is sub-optimal and I'm not quite certain
what the side effect might be. I suspect you may end up with a chart where the order
of values on the X axis isn't the same for the different models, e.g. one graph plotting
the data in ascending order the other one in descending.</p>
<p>The trouble also comes from the fact that we're sorting an iterator (a list of fields) by
telling Python to use a list of dicts to determine the sort order. In this arrangement
there is no way to tell Python how we want to compare our dicts. The only solution I
can think about is creating a custom class and implementing a custom <code>__cmp__()</code> method
for this data structure!</p>

                <p>For some time now I've been hitting
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12506">PhantomJS #12506</a> with the
latest 2.1.1 version. The problem is supposedly fixed in 2.1.0 but this is not
always the case. If you use a .deb package from the latest Ubuntu then the problem
still exists, see

<p>While building from the upstream sources gives</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>ldd /tmp/bin/phantomjs <span class="p">|</span> grep -i qt
</pre></div>


<p>If you take a closer look at PhantomJS's sources you will notice there are
3 git submodules in their repository - <code>3rdparty</code>, <code>qtbase</code> and <code>qtwebkit</code>.
Then in their <code>build.py</code> you can clearly see that this local fork of <code>QtWebKit</code>
is built first, then the <code>phantomjs</code> binary is built against it.</p>
<p>The problem is that these custom forks include additional patches to make
WebKit suitable for Phantom's needs. And these patches are not available
in the stock WebKit library that Ubuntu uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's correct. We need additional functionality that
vanilla QtWebKit doesn't have. That's why we use custom version.</p>
<p>Vitaly Slobodin, PhantomJS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment of this writing Vitaly's qtwebkit fork is 28 commits ahead and
39 commits behind qt:dev. I'm surprised Ubuntu's PhantomJS even works.</p>
<p>The solution IMO is to bundle the additional sources into the src.deb package
and use the same building procedure as upstream.</p>

                    On Python Infinite Loops
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>How do you write an endless loop without using <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, number constants
and comparison operators in Python ?</p>
<p>I've been working on the mutation test tool
<a href="https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray">Cosmic Ray</a> and discovered that it
was missing a boolean replacement operator, that is an operator which will switch
<code>True</code> to <code>False</code> and vice versa, so I wrote one. I've also added some tests to
Cosmic Ray's test suite and then I hit the infinite loop problem.
CR's test suite contains the following code inside a module called <code>adam.py</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">break</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The test suite executes mutations on <code>adam.py</code> and then runs some tests which
it expects to fail. During execution one of the mutations is
<code>replace break with continue</code> which makes the above loop infinite. The test suite
times out after a while and kills the mutation. Everything fails as expected and
we're good.</p>
<p>Adding my boolean replacement operator broke this function. All of the other mutations
work as expected but then the loop becomes</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">break</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When we test this particular mutation there is no infinite loop so Cosmic Ray's
test suite doesn't time out like it should and an error is reported.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>job ID 25:Outcome.SURVIVED:adam
command: cosmic-ray worker adam boolean_replacer 2 unittest -- tests
<span class="gd">--- mutation diff ---</span>
<span class="gd">--- a/home/travis/build/MrSenko/cosmic-ray/test_project/adam.py</span>
<span class="gi">+++ b/home/travis/build/MrSenko/cosmic-ray/test_project/adam.py</span>
<span class="gu">@@ -32,6 +32,6 @@</span>
     return x
 
 def trigger_infinite_loop():
<span class="gd">-    while True:</span>
<span class="gi">+    while False:</span>
         break
</pre></div>


<p>So the question becomes how to write the loop condition in such a way that nothing
will mutate it but it will still remain true so that when <code>break</code> becomes <code>continue</code>
this piece of code will become an infinite loop ? Using <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> constants
obviously is a no go. Same goes for numeric constants, e.g. <code>1</code> or comparison
operators like <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>not</code>, etc. - all of them will be mutated and will
break the loop condition.</p>
<p>So I took a look at the docs for
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html">truth value testing</a> and discovered
<a href="https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/pull/155">my solution</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">break</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I'm creating an object instance here which will not be mutated by any of the
existing mutation operators.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

with a bug on their website! The image above is taken during the first

<p>In
<a href="https://github.com/TuxCon/tuxcon-website/blob/master/js/init.js#L100">init.js:100</a>
there is this piece of code</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">finalDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;2016/07/09&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">});</span>

<p>It counts backwards and updates the HTML until <code>finalDate</code> is reached. Then
the HTML is no longer updated and the default values are shown, which in
this case are non zero. A simple
<a href="https://github.com/TuxCon/tuxcon-website/pull/1">patch</a> fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Initialize your variables properly and happy testing!</p>

                <p><img alt="Puldin creators" src="/images/puldin_creators.jpg" title="Puldin creators" /></p>
<p>Last weekend I visited <a href="http://tuxcon.mobi">TuxCon</a> in Plovdiv and
was very happy to meet and talk to some of the creators of the Puldin
computer! On the picture above are (left to right) Dimitar Georgiev
- wrote the text editor, Ivo Nenov - BIOS, DOS and core OS developer,
Nedyalko Todorov - director of the vendor company and Orlin Shopov -
BIOS, DOS, compiler and core OS developer.</p>
<p>Puldin is 100% pure Bulgarian development, while the “Pravetz” brand
was copy of Apple ][ (Pravetz 8A, 8C, 8M), Oric (Pravets 8D) and IBM-PC
(Pravetz 16). The Puldin computers were build from scratch both hardware
and software and were produced in Plovdiv in the late 80s and early 90s.
50000 pieces were made, at least 35000 of them have been exported to Russia
and paid for. A typical configuration in a Russian class room consisted of
several Puldin computers and a single Pravetz 16. According to Russian sources
the last usage of these computers was in 2003 serving as Linux terminals
and being maintained without any support from the vendor
(b/c it ceased to exist).</p>
<p><img alt="Puldin 601" src="/images/puldin601.jpg" title="Puldin 601" /></p>
<p>One of the main objectives of Puldin was full compatibility with IBM-PC.
At the time IBM had been releasing extensive documentation about how their
software and hardware works which has been used by Puldin's creators as
their software specs. Despite IBM-PC using faster CPU the Puldin 601 had
a comparable performance due to aggressive software and compiler optimizations.</p>
<p>Testing wise the guys used to compare Puldin's functionality with that of IBM-PC.
It was a hard requirement to have full compatibility on the file storage layer,
that means floppy disks written on Puldin had to be readable on IBM-PC and vice
versa. Same goes for programs compiled on Puldin - they had to execute on IBM-PC.</p>
<p>Everything of course had been tested manually and on top of that all the software
had to be burned to ROM before you can do anything with it. As you can imagine the
testing process had been quite slow and painful compared to today's standards.
I've asked the guys if they'd happened to find a bug in IBM-PC which wasn't present
in their code but they couldn't remember.</p>
<p>What was interesting for me on the hardware side was the fact that you can plug
the computer directly to a cheap TV set and that it's been one of the first computers
which could operate on 12V DC, powered directly from a car battery.</p>
<p><img alt="Pravetz 8" src="/images/pravetz16.jpg" title="Pravetz 8" /></p>
<p>There was also a fully functional Pravetz 8 with an additional VGA port to
connect it to the LCD monitor as well as a SD card reader wired to function as a
floppy disk reader (the small black dot behind the joystick).</p>
<p>For those who missed it (and understand Bulgarian) I have a

            </a>
                <p>When designing automated test cases we often think either about increasing
coverage or in terms of testing more use-cases aka behavior scenarios. Both
are valid approaches to improve testing and both of them seem to focus
around execution control flow (or business logic). However program behavior
is sometimes controlled via the contents of its data structures and this is
something which is rarely tested. </p>
<p>In
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/26#discussion_r32790705">this comment</a>
Brian C. Lane and Vratislav Podzimek from Red Hat are talking about a data structure
which maps Fedora versions to particular implementations of kickstart commands.
For example</p>

<p>In their particular case the Fedora 21 <code>logvol</code> implementation introduced the
<code>--profile</code> parameter but in
Fedora 22 and Fedora 23 the <code>logvol</code> command mapped to the Fedora 20 implementation and the
<code>--profile</code> parameter wasn't available. This is unexpected change in program behavior
although the <code>logvol.py</code> and <code>handlers/f22.py</code> files have
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/pykickstart-coverage/blob/master/coverage-report.log">99% and 100% code coverage</a>.</p>
<p>This morning I did some coding and created an automated test for this problem. The test
iterates over all command maps. For each command in the map (that is data structure member)
we load the module which provides all possible implementations for that command. In the
loaded module
we search for implementations which have newer versions than what is in the map,
but not newer than the current Fedora version under test. With a little bit of pruning
the current list of offenses is</p>

<p>The first two are possibly false negatives or related to the naming conventions used
in this module. However the rest appear to be legitimate problems. The <code>user</code> command
has introduced the <code>--groups</code> parameter in Fedora 24 (devel is Fedora 25 currently) but the
parser will fail to recognize this parameter. The <code>logvol</code> problem is recognized as well
since it was never patched. And the Fedora 18 <code>network</code> command implements a new property called
<code>hostname</code> which has probably never been available to be used.</p>
<p>You can follow my current work in
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/91">PR #91</a> and happy testing your
data structures.</p>

                    Don't Upgrade Galaxy S5 to Android 6.0
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Samsung is shipping out buggy software like a boss, no doubt about it.
I've written a bit about <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/categories/samsung/">their bugs</a> previously.
However I didn't expect them to release Android 6.0.1 and render my
<a href="http://amzn.to/1tiiqze">Galaxy S5</a> completely useless with respect
to the feature I use the most.</p>
<p><img alt="Lockscreen" src="/images/samsung/lockscreen_bug.jpg" title="Lockscreen" /></p>
<h2>Tell me the weather for Brussels</h2>
<p>So on Monday I've let Android upgrade to 6.0.1 to be completely surprised
that the lockscreen shows the weather report for Brussels, while
I'm based in Sofia. I've checked <em>AccuWeather</em> (I did go to
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">Brussels earlier this year</a>)
but it displayed only Sofia and Thessaloniki. To get rid of this widget
go to <code>Settings -&gt; Lockscreen -&gt; Additional information</code> and turn it off!</p>
<p>I think this weather report comes from GPS/Location based data, which I
have turned off by default but did use a while back ago. After turning
the widget off and back on it didn't appear on the lockscreen. I suspect
they fall back to showing the last good known value when data is missing
instead of handling the error properly.</p>
<h2>Apps are gone</h2>
<p>Some of my installed apps are missing now. So far I've noticed that the
<em>Gallery</em> and <em>S Health</em> icons have disappeared from my homescreen. I think
<em>S Health</em> came from Samsung's app store but still they shouldn't have removed
it silently. Now I wonder what happened to my data.</p>
<p>I don't see why <em>Gallery</em> was removed though. The only way to view pictures
is to use the camera app preview functionality which is kind of grose.</p>
<h2>Grayscale in powersafe mode is gone</h2>
<p>The killer feature on these higher end Galaxy devices is the <em>Powersafe mode</em>
and <em>Ultra Powersafe mode</em>. I use them a lot and by default have my phone in
<em>Powersafe mode</em> with grayscale colors enabled. It is easier on the eyes and
also safes your battery.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> grayscale colors don't affect some displays but these devices use
AMOLED screens which need different amounts of power to display different
colors. More black means less power required!</p>
<p>After the upgrade grayscale is no more. There's not even an on/off switch.
I've managed to find a workaround though. First you need to enable developer mode
by tapping 7 times on <code>About device -&gt; Build number</code>. Then go to
<code>Settings -&gt; Developer options</code>, look for the <code>Hardware Accelerated Rendering</code>
section and select <code>Simulate Color Space -&gt; Monochromacy</code>! This is a bit ugly
hack and doesn't have the convenience of turning colors on/off by tapping
the quick Powersafe mode button at the top of the screen!</p>
<p>It looks like Samsung didn't think this upgrade well enough or didn't test it
well enough ? In my line of work (installation and upgrade testing) I've rarely
seen such a big blunder. Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    How To Hire Software Testers, Pt. 3
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In previous posts (links below) I have described my process of interviewing
QA candidates. Today I'm quoting an excerpt from the book
<a href="http://it-interviews.com/">Mission: My IT career</a>(Bulgarian only) by Ivaylo Hristov,
one of <a href="http://komfo.com">Komfo</a>'s co-founders.</p>
<p><img alt="Fedora pen" src="/images/fedora/pen.png" title="Fedora pen" /></p>
<p>He writes</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Probably the most important personal trait of a QA engineer is to
be able to think outside given boundaries and prejudices
(about software that is). When necessary to be non-conventional and
apply different approaches to the problems being solved. This will help
them find defect which nobody else will notice.

Most often errors/mistakes in software development are made due to
wrong expectations or wrong assumptions. Very often this happens because
developers hope their software will be used in one particular way
(as it was designed to) or that a particular set of data will be returned.
Thus the skill to think outside the box is the most important skill
we (as employers) are looking to find in a QA candidate. At job interviews
you can expect to be given tasks and questions which examine those skills.
</pre></div>


<h2>How would you test a pen?</h2>
<p>This is Ivaylo's favorite question for QA candidates. He's looking for
attention to details and knowing when to stop testing. Some of the possible
answers related to core functionality are</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the pen write in the correct color</li>
<li>Does the color fades over time</li>
<li>Does the pen operate normally at various temperatures? What temperature
  intervals would you choose for testing</li>
<li>Does the pen operate normally at various atmospheric pressure</li>
<li>When writing, does the pen leave excessive ink</li>
<li>When writing, do you get a continuous line or not</li>
<li>What pressure does the user need to apply in order to write a
  continuous line</li>
<li>What surfaces can the pen write on? What surfaces would you test</li>
<li>Are you able to write on a piece of paper if there is something soft underneath</li>
<li>What is the maximum inclination angle at which the pen is able to write
  without problems</li>
<li>Does the ink dry fast</li>
<li>If we spill different liquids onto a sheet of paper, on which we had written
  something, does the ink stay intact or smear</li>
<li>Can you use pencil rubber to erase the ink? What else would you test</li>
<li>How long can you write before we run out of ink</li>
<li>How fat is the ink line</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Ivaylo gives a few more non-obvious answers</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that all labels on the pen/ink cartridge are correctly spelled
  and how durable they are (try to erase them)</li>
<li>Strength test - what is the maximum height you can drop the pen from
  without breaking it</li>
<li>Verify that dimensions are correct</li>
<li>Test if the pen keeps writing after not being used for some time
  (how long)</li>
<li>Testing individual pen components under different temperature and
  atmospheric conditions</li>
<li>Verify that materials used to make the pen are safe, e.g. when you put
  the pen in your mouth</li>
</ul>
<p>When should you stop ? According to the book there can be between 50 and 100
test cases for a single pen, maybe more. It's not a good sign if you stop at
the first 3!</p>
