                    python-libs in RHEL 7.2 broke SSL verification in s3cmd
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Today started with <a href="http://planet.sofiavalley.com">Planet Sofia Valley</a> being
broken again. Indeed it's been broken since last Friday when I've upgraded to
the latest RHEL 7.2. I quickly identified that I was hitting
<a href="https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/issues/647">Issue #647</a>. Then I tried the
git checkout without any luck. This is when I started to suspect that python-libs
has been updated in an incompatible way.</p>
<p>After series of reported bugs,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1284916">rhbz#1284916</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1284930">rhbz#1284930</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue25722">Python#25722</a>, it was clear that
<code>ssl.py</code> was working according to RFC6125, that Amazon S3 was not playing
nicely with this same RFC and that my patch proposal was wrong.
This immediately had me looking upper in the stack at <code>httplib.py</code> and <code>s3cmd</code>.</p>
<p>Indeed there was a change in <code>httplib.py</code> which introduced two parameters,
<em>context</em> and <em>check_hostname</em>, to <code>HTTPSConnection.__init__</code>. The change
also supplied the logic which performs SSL hostname validation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>if not self._context.check_hostname and self._check_hostname:
    try:
        ssl.match_hostname(self.sock.getpeercert(), server_hostname)
    except Exception:
        self.sock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
        self.sock.close()
        raise
</pre></div>


<p>This looks a bit doggy as I don't quite understand the intention behind
<em>not PREDICATE and PREDICATE</em>. Anyway to disable the validation you need
both parameters set to False, which is
<a href="https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/pull/668">PR #668</a>.</p>
<p>Notice the two try-except blocks. This is in case we're running with a
version that has a context but not the check_hostname parameter. I've found
the <em>inspect.getmembers</em> function which can be used to figure out what
parameters are there for the init method but a solution based on it
doesn't appear to be more elegant. I will describe this in more details in
my next post.</p>

                    GitHub Bugzilla Hook
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Last month I've created a tool which adds comments to Bugzilla when a commit
message references a bug number. It was done as a proof of concept and didn't
receive much attention at the time. Today I'm happy to announce the existence
of <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/github-bugzilla-hook">GitHub Bugzilla Hook</a>.</p>
<p>I've used David Shea's
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/github-email-hook/">GitHub Email Hook</a> as my
starting template and only modified it where needed. GitHub Bugzilla Hook will
examine push data and post comments for every unique bug+branch combination.
Once a comment for that particular bug+branch combination is made, new ones
will not be posted, even if later commits reference the same bug.
My main assumption is commits which are related to a bug will be pushed together
most of the times so there shouldn't be lots of noise in Bugzilla.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274703">rhbz#1274703</a> for
example of how the comments look. The parser behavior is taken from anaconda
and conforms to the style the Red Hat Installer Engineering Team uses.
Hopefully you find it useful as well.</p>
<p>My next step is to find a hosting place for this script and hook it up
with the rhinstaller GitHub repos!</p>

                    Bad Stub Design in DNF, Pt.2
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Do you remember my example of a
<a href="/blog/2015/09/25/unit-testing-bad-stub-design-in-dnf/">bad stub design in DNF</a> ?
At that time I didn't have a good example of why this is a bad design and what are the
consequences of it. Today I have!</p>
<p>From my comment on
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/118">PR #118</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the benefit of this patch are quite subtle.
I've played around with creating a few more tests and the benefit I see affect
only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>For #114 there doesn't seem to be any need to test _get_query directly,
although we call</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>   q = self.base.sack.query()
   q = q.available()
</pre></div>


<p>which will benefit from this PR b/c we're stubbing out the entire Sack object.
I will work on a test later today/tomorrow to see how it looks.</p>
<p>OTOH for #113 where we modify _get_query the test can look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>def test_get_query_with_local_rpm(self):
    try:
        (fs, rpm_path) = tempfile.mkstemp(&#39;foobar-99.99-1.x86_64.rpm&#39;)
        # b/c self.cmd.cli.base is a mock object add_remote_rpm
        # will not update the available packages while testing.
        # it is expected to hit an exception
        with self.assertRaises(dnf.exceptions.PackageNotFoundError):
            self.cmd._get_query(rpm_path)
        self.cmd.cli.base.add_remote_rpm.assert_called_with(rpm_path)
    finally:
        os.remove(rpm_path)
</pre></div>


<p>Note the comment above the with block. If we leave out <code>_get_query</code> as before
(a simple stub function) we're not going to be able to use <code>assert_called_with</code>
later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now a more practical example. See 
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/commit/fe130669ffc4c1d6eba8f10cda35ab4d803d5a3d">commit fe13066</a>
- in case the package is not found we log the error. In case configuration is
<code>strict=True</code> then the plugin will raise another exception. With the initial version
of the stubs this change in behavior is silently ignored. If there was an error
in the newly introduced lines it would go straight into production because the
existing tests passed.</p>
<p>What happens is that <code>test_get_packages()</code> calls <code>_get_packages(['notfound'])</code>,
which is not the real code but a test stub and returns an empty list in this case.
The empty list is expected from the test and it will not fail!</p>
<p>With my new stub design the test will execute the actual <code>_get_packages()</code>
method from <code>download.py</code> and choke on the exception. The test itself needs
to be modified, which is done in
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/dnf-plugins-core/commit/2c2b34237c99cbf32e23bde43027d22873f4e8b7">commit 2c2b34</a>
and no further errors were found.</p>
<p>So let me summarize:
<strong>
When using mocks, stubs and fake objects we should be replacing external
dependencies of the software under test, not internal methods from the SUT!
</strong></p>

            <p>This is mostly for self reference because it is not currently documented
in the code. To use dnf plugins from a local git checkout modify your

                    Revamping Anaconda's Dogtail Tests
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>In my <a href="/blog/2015/11/13/running-anaconda-from-git/">previous post</a> I briefly talked
about running anaconda from a git checkout. My goal was to rewrite <code>tests/gui/</code> so
that they don't use a LiveCD and virtual machines anymore. I'm pleased to announce
that this is already done (still not merged), see 
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/457">PR#457</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the changes are just shuffling bits around and deleting
unused code. The existing UI tests were mostly working and only needed minor
changes. There are two things which didn't work and are temporarily disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the Help button results in 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282432">rhbz#1282432</a>,
which in turn may be hiding another bug behind it;</li>
<li>Looping over the available languages resulted in AT-SPI NonImplementedError
which I'm going to debug next.</li>
</ul>
<p>To play around with this make sure you have accessibility enabled and:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># cd anaconda/
# export top_srcdir=`pwd`
# setenforce 0
# cd tests/gui/
# ./run_gui_tests.sh
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> you also need Dogtail for Python3 which isn't officially available
yet. I'm building from
<a href="https://vhumpa.fedorapeople.org/dogtail/beta/dogtail3-0.9.1-0.3.beta3.src.rpm">https://vhumpa.fedorapeople.org/dogtail/beta/dogtail3-0.9.1-0.3.beta3.src.rpm</a></p>
<p>My future plans are to figure out how to re-enable what is temporarily
disabled, update <code>run_gui_tests.sh</code> to properly start gnome-session and
enable accessibility, do a better job cleaning up after a failure,
enable coverage and hook everything into <code>make ci</code>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>It is now possible to execute anaconda directly from a git checkout.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this is only for testing purposes, you are not supposed to
execute anaconda from git and install a running system! My intention is
to use this feature and rewrite the Dogtail tests inside <code>tests/gui/</code> which
rely on having a LiveCD.iso and running VMs to execute. For me this has proven
very slow and difficult to debug problems in the past hence the change.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> you will need to have an active DISPLAY in your environment and
also set SELinux to permissive, see 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1276376">rhbz#1276376</a>.</p>

                    UI Usability Bug for QAChallengeAccepted.com
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p><img alt="Initial view" src="/images/qachallenge1.png" title="Initial view" /></p>
<p>Today I wanted to submit a presentation proposal for
<a href="http://qachallengeaccepted.com">QA Challenge Accepted 2016</a> and found a usability
problem in their website. The first picture is how the UI looks on my screen.
As you can see the screen height is enough to show the first section of the
interface. There's something orange at the bottom which isn't clearly identifiable.
The next picture shows the UI as it looks after clicking on the PROGRAM menu link.</p>
<p><img alt="View after clicking the menu" src="/images/qachallenge2.png" title="View after clicking the menu" /></p>
<p>The problem is that I never saw the orange section, which turned out to be
the call for papers and a link to the submission form. To fix this the orange
section either needs to go at the top and be clearly visible or at least a new
item be added to the menu.</p>
<p>Btw the next event will be in March 2016 in Sofia and I hope to see you there!</p>

            </a>
            <p>In my <a href="/blog/2015/10/15/anaconda-coverage.py-details/">previous post</a>
I've talked about testing anaconda and friends and raised some questions.
Today I'm going to give an example of how to answer one of them:
"How different is the code execution path between different tests?"</p>
<h2>coverate-tools</h2>
<p>I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/coverage-tools">coverage-tools</a>
in my explanations below so a little introduction is required. All the tools
are executable Python scripts which build on top of existing coverage.py API.
The difference is mainly in flexibility of parameters and output formatting.
I've tried to keep as close as possible to the existing behavior of coverage.py.</p>
<p><em>coverage-annotate</em> - when given a .coverage data file prints the source code
annotated with line numbers and execution markers.</p>

<p>In the example above all lines starting with <strong>&gt;</strong> were executed by the interpreter.
All top-level import statements were executed as you would expect. Then the method
<em>get_help_width()</em> was executed (called from somewhere). Because this was on x86_64
machine line 63 was not executed. It is marked with <strong>!</strong>. The comments and empty
lines are of no interest.</p>
<p><em>coverage-diff</em> - produces git like diff reports on the text output of annotate.</p>

<p>In this example line 637 was not executed in the first test run, while it was executed
in the second test run. Reading the comments above it is clear the difference between
the two test runs is just timing and synchronization.</p>
<h2>Kickstart vs. Kickstart</h2>
<p>How different is the code execution path between different tests? Looking at
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Results:Fedora_23_Final_RC3_Installation">Fedora 23 test results</a>
we see several tests which differ only slightly in their setup - installation
via HTTP, FTP or NFS; installation to SATA, SCSI, SAS drives; installation using
RAID for the root file system; These are good candidates for further analysis.</p>
<p>Note: my results below are not from Fedora 23 but the conclusions still apply!
The tests were executed on bare metal and virtual machines, trying to use the
same hardware or same systems configurations where possible!</p>

<p>The difference in <code>source.py</code> is from timing/synchronization and can safely be ignored.
I'm not exactly sure about <code>__init__.py</code> but doesn't look much of a big deal.
We're left with <code>resize.py</code>. The differences in <em>on_key_pressed()</em> are because
I've probably used the keyboard instead the mouse (these are indeed manual installs).
The other difference is in how the partition labels are displayed. One of the installs
was probably using fresh disks while the other not.</p>

<p>As you can see the difference is minimal, mostly related to the underlying
hardware. As far as I can tell this has to do with how the bootloader is
installed on disk but I'm no expert on this particular piece of code.
I've seen the same difference in other comparisons so it probably has to do
more with hardware than with what kind of disk/driver is used.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell the difference is related to hardware clock settings,
probably due to different defaults in BIOS on the various hardware.
Additional tests with RAID 5 and RAID 6 reveals the same exact difference.
RAID 0 vs. RAID 10 shows no difference at all. Indeed as far as I know anaconda
delegates the creation of RAID arrays to mdadm once the desired configuration
is known so these results are to be expected.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see sometimes there are tests which appear to be very important
but in reality they cover a corner case of the base test. For example if any
of the RAID levels works we can be pretty confident 
<strike>all of them work</strike> <em>they won't break in anaconda</em>
(thanks Adam Williamson)!</p>
<p>What you do with this information is up to you. Sometimes QA is able to
execute all the tests and life is good. Sometimes we have to compromise,
skip some testing and accept the risks of doing so. Sometimes you can
execute all tests for every build, sometimes only once per milestone.
Whatever the case having the information to back up your decision is vital!</p>
<p>In my next post on this topic I'm going to talk more about functional tests
vs. unit tests. Both anaconda and blivet have both kinds of tests and I'm
interested to know if tests from the two categories focus on the same
functionality how are they different. If we have a unit test for feature X,
does it warrant to spend the resources doing functional testing for X as well?</p>

                    Anaconda &amp; coverage.py - Pt.2 - Details
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>My <a href="/blog/2015/10/14/anaconda-coverage.py-introduction/">previous post</a>
was an introduction to testing installation related components. Now I'm going to
talk more about anaconda and how it is tested.</p>
<p>There are two primary ways to test anaconda. You can execute <code>make check</code> in the
source directory which will trigger the package test suite. The other possibility
is to perform an actual installation, on bare meta or virtual machine, using the
<a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mash/">latest Rawhide snapshots</a> which also
include the latest anaconda. For both of these methods we can collect code
coverage information. In live installation mode coverage is enabled via the
<code>inst.debug</code> boot argument. Fedora 23 and earlier use <code>debug=1</code> but that
can lead to <a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/291">problems</a>
sometimes.</p>
<h2>Kickstart Testing</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/blob/master/docs/kickstart-docs.rst">Kickstart</a>
is a method of automating the installation of Fedora by supplying the necessary
configuration into a text file and pointing the installer at this file. There is
the directory <code>tests/kickstart_tests</code>, inside the anaconda source, where each
test is a kickstart file and a shell script. The test runner provisions a virtual
machine using boot.iso and the kickstart file. A shell script then verifies
installation was as expected and copies files of interest to the host system.
Kickstart files are also the basis for testing Fedora installations in
<a href="https://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/jobs/">Beaker</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally some of these in-package kickstart tests are the same as
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/fedoraqa/fedora-beaker-tests/">out-of-band kickstart tests</a>.
Hint: there are more available but not yet public.</p>
<p>The question which I don't have an answer for right now is
"Can we remove some of the duplicates and how this affects devel and QE teams" ?
The pros of in-package testing are that it is faster compared to Beaker. The cons
are that you're not testing the real distro (every snapshot is a possible final
release to the users).</p>
<h2>Dogtail</h2>
<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/">Dogtail</a> uses accessibility technologies to
communicate with desktop applications. It is written in Python and can be used
as GUI test automation framework. Long time ago I've proposed support for Dogtail
in anaconda which was rejected, then couple of years later it was accepted and
later removed from the code again.</p>
<p>Anaconda has in-package Dogtail tests (<code>tests/gui/</code>). They work by attaching
a second disk image with the test suite to a VM running a LiveCD. Anaconda is
started on the LiveCD and an attempt to install Fedora on disk 1 is made.
Everything is driven by the Dogtail scripts. There are only a few of these
tests available and they are currently disabled.
Red Hat QE has also created another method for running Dogtail tests in anaconda
using an updates.img with the previous functionality.</p>
<p>Even if there are some duplicate tests I'm not convinced we have to drop the
<code>tests/gui/</code> directory from the code because
the framework used to drive the graphical interface of anaconda appears to be very
well written. The code is clean and easy to follow.
Also I don't have metrics of how much these two methods differ or how much they cover
in their testing. IMO they are pretty close and before we can find a way to
reliably execute them on a regular basis there isn't much to be done here.
One idea is to use the <code>--dirinstall</code> or <code>--image</code> options and skip the
LiveCD part entirely.</p>
<h2>How Much is Tested</h2>
<p><code>make ci</code> covers 10% of the entire code base for anaconda. Mind you that
<code>tests/storage</code> and <code>tests/gui</code> are currently disabled.
See <a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/346">PR #346</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/327">PR #327</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/319">PR #319</a>!
There is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>On the other hand live installation testing is much
better. Text mode covers around 25% while graphical installations around 40%.
Text and graphical combined cover 50% though. These numbers will drop quite a bit
once anaconda learns to
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/pull/397">include all possible files</a>
in its report but it is a good estimate.</p>
<p>The important questions to ask here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much can PyUnit tests cover in anaconda?</li>
<li>How much can kickstart tests cover ?</li>
<li>Have we reached a threshold in any of the two primary methods for testing ?</li>
<li>Does UI automation (with Dogtail) improve anything ?</li>
<li>When testing a particular feature (say user creation) how different is the
code execution path between manual (GUI) testing, kickstart and unit testing ?
If not so different can we invest in unit tests instead of higher level tests then ?</li>
<li>How different is the code execution path between different tests (manual or kickstart) ?
In other words how much value are we getting from testing for the resources we're putting in ?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post I will talk more about these questions and some rudimentary
analysis against coverage data from the various test methods and test cases!</p>

                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Since early 2015 I've been working on testing installation related
components in Rawhide. I'm interested in the code produced by the
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/">Red Hat Installer Engineering Team</a> and in
particular in <em>anaconda</em>, <em>blivet</em>, <em>pyparted</em> and <em>pykickstart</em>. The goal of
this effort is to improve the overall testing of these components and also
have Red Hat QE contribute some of our knowledge back to the community. The benefit
of course will be better software for everyone. In the next
several posts I'll summarize what has been done so far and what's to be expected
in the future.</p>
<h2>Test Documentation Matters</h2>
<p>Do you want others to contribute tests? I certainly do! When I started looking
at the code it was obviously clear there was no documentation related to testing.
Everyone needs to know how to write and execute these tests! Currently we have
basic README files describing how to install necessary dependencies for development
and test execution, how to execute the tests (and what can be tested) and most
importantly what is the test architecture. There is description of how the file
structure is organized and which are the base classes to inherit from when adding
new tests. Most of the times each component goes through a <em>pylint</em> check and
a standard PyUnit test suite.</p>
<p>Test documentation is usually in a <code>tests/README</code> file. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/master/tests/README.rst">anaconda</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/blivet/blob/master/tests/README.rst">blivet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/blob/master/tests/README.rst">pykickstart</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pyparted/blob/master/tests/README.rst">pyparted</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've tried to explain as much as possible without bloating the files and going into
unnecessary details. If you spot something missing please send a pull request.</p>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>This has been largely an effort driven by Chris Lumens from the devel team.
All the components I'm interested in are tested regularly in a CI environment.
There is a <code>make ci</code> Makefile target for those of you interested in what exactly
gets executed.</p>
<h2>Test Coverage</h2>
<p>In order to <strong>improve</strong> something you need to know where you stand. We'll I didn't.
That's why the first step was to integrate the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy">coverage.py</a> tool with all of these components.</p>
<p>With the exception of blivet (written in C) all of the other
components integrate well with coverage.py and produce good statistics. pykickstart is
the champ here with 90% coverage, while anaconda is somewhere between 10% and 50%.
Full test coverage measurement for anaconda isn't straight forward and will be the
subject of my next post. For the C based code we have to hook up with
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">Gcov</a> which shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
<p>At the moment there are several open pull requests to integrate the coverage test
targets with <code>make ci</code> and also report the results in human readable form. I will be
collecting these for historical references.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>I've created some basic text-mode
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/coverage-tools">coverage-tools</a> to help me combine and
compare data from different executions. These are only the start of it and I'm expanding
them as my needs for reporting and analytics evolve. I'm also looking into
<a href="/blog/2015/07/27/call-for-ideas-graphical-test-coverage-reports/">more detailed coverage reports</a>
but I don't have enough data and use cases to work on this front at the moment.</p>
<p>Some ideas currently in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>map code changes (git commits) to existing test coverage to get a feeling where to
invest in more testing;</li>
<li>map bugs to code areas and to existing test coverage to see if we aren't
missing tests in areas where the bugs are happening;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>coverage.py is a very nice tool indeed but I guess most people use it in a very
limited way. Shortly after I started working with it I've found several places which
need improvements. These have to do with combining and reporting on multiple files.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting issues I've found and still open are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-requests/63/">PR #63 - New option --dont-remove when combining coverage data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/425">#425 - source parameter not including files which are explicitly specified</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/426">#426 - Difference between coverage results with source specifies full dir instead of module name</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post I will talk about anaconda code coverage and what I want to do with it.
In the mean time please use the comments to share your feedback.</p>

            <p>In software testing, usually unit testing, test stubs are programs that simulate
the behaviors of external dependencies that a module undergoing the test depends
on. Test stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test.</p>
<p>I've discovered an improperly written stub method in one of
<a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/">DNF</a>'s tests:</p>

<p>As seen here <em>stub_fn</em> replaces the <em>_get_query</em> methods from the class under
test. At the time of writing this has probably seemed like a good idea to
speed up writing the tests.</p>
<p>The trouble is we should be replacing the external dependencies of <em>_get_query</em>
(other parts of DNF essentially) and not methods from <em>DownloadCommand</em>. To
understand why this is a bad idea check
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/113">PR #113</a>,
which directly modifies <em>_get_query</em>. There's no way to test this patch
with the current state of the test.</p>
<p>So I took a few days to experiment and update the current test stubs. The
result is 
<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-core/pull/118">PR #118</a>.
The important bits are the <em>SackStub</em> and <em>SubjectStub</em> classes which hold
information about the available RPM packages on the system. The rest are cosmetics
to fit around the way the query objects are used (q.available(), q.latest(), q.filter()).
The proposed design correctly overrides the external dependencies on
<em>dnf.subject.Subject</em> and <em>self.base.sack</em> which are initialized before our
plugin is loaded by DNF.</p>
<p>I must say this is the first error of this kind I've seen in my QA practice so far.
I have no idea if this was a minor oversight or something which happens more frequently
in open source projects but it's a great example nevertheless.</p>
<p>For those of you who'd like to get started on unit testing I can recommend the book

conform to the new
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Harden_All_Packages">Harden All Packages</a>
policy in Fedora!</p>
<p>From 46884 RPMs, 17385 are 'x86_64' meaning they may contain ELF objects.
From them 4489 are reported as failed <code>checksec</code>.</p>
<p>What you should see as the output from <code>checksec is</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    DSO             No RPATH   No RUNPATH
</pre></div>


<p>The first line is for binaries, the second one for libraries b/c
DSOs on x86_64 are always position-independent. Some RPATHs are acceptable,
e.g. <code>%{_libdir}/foo/</code> and I've tried to exclude them unless
other offenses are found. The script which does this is
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/checksec-collect">checksec-collect</a>.</p>
<p>Most often I'm seeing <em>Partial RELRO</em>, <em>No canary found</em> and <em>No PIE</em> errors.
Since all packages potentially process untrusted input, it makes sense for all of them
to be hardened and enhance the security of Fedora. That's why all of these errors
should be considered valid bugs.</p>
<h2>Attn package maintainers</h2>
<p>Please see if your package is in the list and try to fix it or let me know
why it should be excluded, for example it's a boot loader and doesn't function
properly with hardening enabled. The full list is available at
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/checksec.log">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>There's a typo in the Bulgarian translation of Messenger.com.
It is highlighted by the red dot on the picture.</p>
<p><em>hunspell</em> easily catches it so either Facebook doesn't run their
translations through a spell checker or their spell checker is
borked.</p>

                    Pedometer Bug in Samsung S Health
                </h2>

            <p>Do you remember the 
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/pedometer-bug-in-samsung-gear-fit-smartwatch/">pedometer bug in Samsung Gear Fit</a>
I've discovered earlier ? It turns out that Samsung is a fan of this one
and has the exact same bug in their <em>S Health</em> application.</p>
<p>The application doesn't block pedometer(e.g. steps counting) while
performing other activities such as cycling for example. So in reallity it
reports incorrect value for burned callories. At this time I call it
bad software development practice/architecture on Samsung's part which leads
to this bug being present.</p>

                    Call for Ideas: Graphical Test Coverage Reports
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>
<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>
<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>
<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format, 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a 
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>
<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>
<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at 
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>
<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

and while the hardware seems good I'm a bit disapointed on the software side.
There is at least one bug which is clearly visible - <strong>pedometer counts calories twice
when it's on and exercise mode is started</strong>.</p>
<p>How to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the <em>Pedometer</em> app and record any initial readings;</li>
<li>Walk a fixed distance and at the end record all readings;</li>
<li>Now go back to the <em>Exercise</em> app and select a <em>Walking</em>
exercise from the menu. Tap <em>Start</em>;</li>
<li>Walk back the same distance/road as before. At the end of the journey
stop the walking exercise and record all readings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected results:</p>
<p>At the end of the trip I expect to see roughly the same calories burned
for both directions.</p>
<p>Actual results:</p>
<p>The return trip counted twice as many calories compared to the forward trip.
Here's some actual data to prove it:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Data values above were taken from Samsung's <em>S Health</em> app which is easier to work with
instead of the Gear Fit itself.</p>
<p>The problem is that both apps are accessing the sensor simultaneously and not aware of each other.
In theory it should be relatively easy to block access of one app while the other is running but
that may not be so easy to implement on the limited platform the Gear Fit is.</p>

                    2 Barcode Related Bugs in MyFitnessPal
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p><img alt="Barcode that fails to scan" src="/images/barcode/fail.jpg" title="Barcode that fails to scan" /></p>
<p><strong>Did you know that the popular <em>MyFitnessPal</em> application can't scan barcodes
printed on curved surfaces?</strong> The above barcode fails to scan because it is
printed on a metal can full of roasted almonds :). In contrast the
<em>Barcode Scanner</em> from <em>ZXing Team</em> understands it just fine. My bet is
<em>MyFitnessPal</em> uses less advanced barcode scanning library. Judging from
the visual clues in the app the issue is between 6 and 0 where white space is wider.</p>
<p><img alt="Barcode that scans fine" src="/images/barcode/pass.jpg" title="Barcode that scans fine" /></p>
<p>Despite being a bit blurry this second barcode is printed on a flat surface and
is understood by both <em>MyFitnessPal</em> and "ZXing Barcode Scanner".</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> I get the same results regardless if I try to scan the actual barcode
printed on packaging, a picture from a mobile device screen or these two images
from the laptop screen.</p>
<p><strong>MyFitnessPal also has problems with duplicate barcodes!</strong> Barcodes are not unique
and many producers use the same code for multiple products. I've seen this in the
case of two different varieties of salami from the same manufacturer on the good end
and two different products produced across the world (eggs and popcorn) on the
extreme end.</p>
<p>Once the user scans their barcodes and establish that the existing information is
not correct they can <em>Create a Food</em> and update the calories database. This is then
synced back to MyFitnesPal servers and overrides any existing information. When the same
barcode is scanned for the second time only the new DB entry is visible.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan an existing barcode and enter it to MFP database if not already there;</li>
<li>Scan the same barcode one more time and pretend the information is not correct;</li>
<li>Click the <em>Create a Food</em> button and fill-in the fields. For example use a
different food name to distinguish between the two database entries. Save!</li>
<li>From another device with different account (to verify information in DB)
scan the same barcode again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actual results:
The last entered information is shown.</p>
<p>Expected results:
User is shown both DB records and can select between them.</p>
