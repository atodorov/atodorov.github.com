    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>

<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>

<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>

<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>

<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>

<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>

<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

<p>Recently I've been playing around with a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J4DY8RU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00J4DY8RU&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=RNJGVYUTOOJFGWOU">Samsung Gear Fit</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00J4DY8RU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and while the hardware seems good I'm a bit disapointed on the software side.
There is at least one bug which is clearly visible - <strong>pedometer counts calories twice
when it's on and exercise mode is started</strong>.</p>

<p>How to test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the <em>Pedometer</em> app and record any initial readings;</li>
<li>Walk a fixed distance and at the end record all readings;</li>
<li>Now go back to the <em>Exercise</em> app and select a <em>Walking</em>
exercise from the menu. Tap <em>Start</em>;</li>
<li>Walk back the same distance/road as before. At the end of the journey
stop the walking exercise and record all readings.</li>
</ul>


<p>Expected results:</p>

<p>At the end of the trip I expect to see roughly the same calories burned
for both directions.</p>

<p>Actual results:</p>

<p>The return trip counted twice as many calories compared to the forward trip.
Here's some actual data to prove it:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Data values above were taken from Samsung's <em>S Health</em> app which is easier to work with
instead of the Gear Fit itself.</p>

<p>The problem is that both apps are accessing the sensor simultaneously and not aware of each other.
In theory it should be relatively easy to block access of one app while the other is running but
that may not be so easy to implement on the limited platform the Gear Fit is.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/07/2-barcode-related-bugs-in-myfitnesspal/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-07T14:44:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/07/2-barcode-related-bugs-in-myfitnesspal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/barcode/fail.jpg" title="Barcode that fails to scan" alt="Barcode that fails to scan" /></p>

<p><strong>Did you know that the popular <em>MyFitnessPal</em> application can't scan barcodes
printed on curved surfaces?</strong> The above barcode fails to scan because it is
printed on a metal can full of roasted almonds :). In contrast the
<em>Barcode Scanner</em> from <em>ZXing Team</em> understands it just fine. My bet is
<em>MyFitnessPal</em> uses less advanced barcode scanning library. Judging from
the visual clues in the app the issue is between 6 and 0 where white space is wider.</p>

<p><img src="/images/barcode/pass.jpg" title="Barcode that scans fine" alt="Barcode that scans fine" /></p>

<p>Despite being a bit blurry this second barcode is printed on a flat surface and
is understood by both <em>MyFitnessPal</em> and "ZXing Barcode Scanner".</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> I get the same results regardless if I try to scan the actual barcode
printed on packaging, a picture from a mobile device screen or these two images
from the laptop screen.</p>

<p><strong>MyFitnessPal also has problems with duplicate barcodes!</strong> Barcodes are not unique
and many producers use the same code for multiple products. I've seen this in the
case of two different varieties of salami from the same manufacturer on the good end
and two different products produced across the world (eggs and popcorn) on the
extreme end.</p>

<p>Once the user scans their barcodes and establish that the existing information is
not correct they can <em>Create a Food</em> and update the calories database. This is then
synced back to MyFitnesPal servers and overrides any existing information. When the same
barcode is scanned for the second time only the new DB entry is visible.</p>

<p>How to reproduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scan an existing barcode and enter it to MFP database if not already there;</li>
<li>Scan the same barcode one more time and pretend the information is not correct;</li>
<li>Click the <em>Create a Food</em> button and fill-in the fields. For example use a
different food name to distinguish between the two database entries. Save!</li>
<li>From another device with different account (to verify information in DB)
scan the same barcode again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Actual results:
The last entered information is shown.</p>

<p>Expected results:
User is shown both DB records and can select between them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year everyone. During the holidays I've discovered several interesting
bugs which will be revealed in this blog. Starting today with a bug in the popular
game <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>.</p>

<p>In level 80 one teleport is still open but the chocolates are blocking the rest.
The game has ended but candies keep flowing through the teleport and the level doesn't exit.
My guess is that the game logic is missing a check whether or not it will go into an endless loop.</p>

<p>This bug seems to be generic for the entire game. It pops up also on
level 137 in the Owl part of the game (recorded by somebody else):</p>
