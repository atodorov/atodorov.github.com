    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I <a href="/blog/2013/09/14/upcoming-talk-fedora-test-days-in-sofia/">mentioned earlier</a>
I will organize some Fedora testing in Sofia. Here's an outline of my talk this
Saturday and a general guide for anyone who wants to participate.</p>

<h2>What are Fedora Test Days</h2>

<p>Fedora Test Days are day long events focused on testing a particular feature
in the upcoming Fedora release. At the time of writing they are focused on
Fedora 20.</p>

<h2>What You Need Before Joining Fedora</h2>

<ul>

<li>A <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/user/new">Fedora account</a>. Please
complete the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join">onboarding process</a> in advance
as it takes time;</li>
<li>Create a wiki page for your profile. Mine is
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Atodorov">here</a>. This will verify you can

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-15T10:23:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To all my readers - sorry for not being able to blog more frequently lately.
Here's an easy read about my favourite laptop brand Lenovo and some of their
design flaws I've found.</p>

<h2>X220 and T60 Batterries are ALMOST Identical</h2>

<p><img src="/images/lenovo_x220_t60_battery.jpg" title="X220 and T60 batteries" alt="&quot;X220 and T60 batteries&quot;" /></p>

<p>As you can see the <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">X220</a> and
<a href="http://amzn.to/183SgiR">T60</a> batteries are nearly identical with the notable
exception of the connector placement. The end result - I have to purchase yet another
battery as a backup for long travel/work on the go. Not what I want.</p>

<p>I wish all Lenovo models had the same batteries so people can swap them around
as they wish. Is this too much to ask for? Have you seen another brand which
got this right?</p>

<h2>ThinkPad Mini Dock Design Flaw</h2>

<p>I'm using a <a href="http://amzn.to/15tjUYi">ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</a> docking station
with my X220 laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn't quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/alone.jpg" title="docking station in position 2" alt="docking station in position 2" /></p>

<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/top.jpg" title="top view" alt="top view" />
<img src="/images/dock/back.jpg" title="back view" alt="back view" />
<img src="/images/dock/side.jpg" title="side view" alt="side view" /></p>

<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/removed.jpg" title="blocking part removed" alt="blocking part removed" /></p>

<p>Even with this piece removed my laptop still hets up too much! I guess 80 C is just
normal for the Core i7 processors :(.</p>

<p>Have you found something not quite right in your hardware design? Please share in the
comments.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-14T23:11:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/14/upcoming-talk-fedora-test-days-in-sofia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick
some developers' ass this is the way to do it!</p>

<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov's „Oracle's take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

<p>PS: this post was initially written on my <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>
with Penzus Editor - another small step in
<a href="/blog/2013/08/01/laptop-vs-smartphone-part-one/">retiring my laptop</a>.</p>
