<p>There's a typo in the Bulgarian translation of Messenger.com.
It is highlighted by the red dot on the picture.</p>

<p><em>hunspell</em> easily catches it so either Facebook doesn't run their
translations through a spell checker or their spell checker is
borked.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/pedometer-bug-in-samsung-gear-fit-smartwatch/">pedometer bug in Samsung Gear Fit</a>
I've discovered earlier ? It turns out that Samsung is a fan of this one
and has the exact same bug in their <em>S Health</em> application.</p>

<p>The application doesn't block pedometer(e.g. steps counting) while
performing other activities such as cycling for example. So in reallity it
reports incorrect value for burned callories. At this time I call it
bad software development practice/architecture on Samsung's part which leads
to this bug being present.</p>

<p>Btw for more interesting bugs see

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are working with Python and writing unit tests chances are you are
familiar with the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/">coverage</a> reporting
tool. However there are testing scenarios in which we either don't use unit tests
or maybe execute different code paths(test cases) independent of each other.</p>

<p>For example, this is the case with installation testing in Fedora. Because anaconda
- the installer is very complex the easiest way is to test it live, not with unit tests.
Even though we can get a coverage report (anaconda is written in Python) it reflects
only the test case it was collected from.</p>

<p><code>coverage combine</code> can be used to combine several data files and produce an aggregate
report. This can tell you how much test coverage you have across all your tests.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell Python's coverage doesn't tell you how many times a particular
line of code has been executed. It also doesn't tell you which test cases executed
a particular line
(see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/59">PR #59</a>).
In the Fedora example, I have the feeling many of our tests are touching the same
code base and not contributing that much to the overall test coverage.
So I started working on these items.</p>

<p>I imagine a script which will read coverage data from several test executions
(preferably in JSON format,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/pull-request/60">PR #60</a>) and produce a
graphical report similar to what GitHub does for your commit activity.</p>

<p>See an example <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/pykickstart_report.html">here</a>!</p>

<p>The example uses darker colors to indicate more line executions, lighter for less
executions. Check the HTML for the actual numbers b/c there are no hints yet.
The input JSON files are
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/coverage_json_reports.tar.gz">here</a> and
the script to generate the above HTML is at
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts/blob/master/coverage-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Now I need your ideas and comments!</p>

<p>What kinds of coverage reports are you using in your job ? How do you generate them ?
How do they look like ?</p>

<p>This is a slightly annoying UI bug in

it and hopefully they will fix it.</p>
