    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick
some developers' ass this is the way to do it!</p>

<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov's „Oracle's take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

<p>PS: this post was initially written on my <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>

    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/02/bug-analysis-of-rhbz-1337</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-ebugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">previous post</a>
I asked the readers of this blog to pick a bug number from Red Hat's Bugzilla
so I can analyze it later.</p>

<p><a href="http://radorado.me">Radoslav Georgiev</a> decided to step up and
selected the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">Leet</a> bug
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337</a></p>

<p>This is a rather old bug against kernel, in particular
against the token ring driver. There isn't much info on the bug but it seems
the issue is hardware dependent and doesn't reproduce reliably.</p>

<p>Looking at the bug status and history it looks like it was closed without
fixing it. Most likely the reason for this was there was no hardware
to test, bug was not reproduced and no customers were seeing the issue or
were willing to test and work with devel!</p>

<p>If you'd like to see my comments on other interesting bugs just post a link
to them in the comments section.</p>

<p>Red Hat's Bugzilla passed the 1 million bugs milestone yesterday!
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000">RHBZ #1000000</a> has been
filed by Anton Arapov, a kernel engineer and a very nice guy (I know him btw).
I've filed several bugs yesterday but the last one was #999941. A bit too short!</p>

<p>To celebrate this event I dare you to pick some bugs from Bugzilla that you find
interesting or frustrating and I will try to analyze and explain them from a
QA engineer's point of view. Since I've reported over 1000 bugs and been involved in
another close to 5000 I think I will be able to answer almost any question.</p>

<p>Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I've been having troubles with Twitter lately but this bug is just annoying!
Where on Earth is the "code below" ? I've already
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/370833992074809345">reported it</a>. Let's
see how long it takes for them to fix it!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/07/notes-from-two-interesting-guadec-talks/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-07T14:33:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/07/notes-from-two-interesting-guadec-talks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As this year's <a href="https://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> is coming to an end
I'm publishing an interesting update from
<a href="cz.linkedin.com/in/mullerpetr">Petr Muller</a> for
those who were not able to attend.
Petr is a Senior Quality Engineer at Red Hat. His notes were
sent to an internal QE mailing list and re-published with permission.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>As this year's GUADEC happened in the same building where I have my<br/>other office, I decided to attend. I'm sharing my notes from the two<br/>sessions I consider to be especially interesting for the audience of<br/>this mailing list:</p></p><p><p>== How to not report your UX bug ==<br/>Speaker:    Fabiana Simões<br/>Blog:       http://fabianapsimoes.wordpress.com/<br/>Twitter:    https://twitter.com/fabianapsimoes</p></p><p><p>Do not do this stuff:<br/>* Do not simply present a preferred solution, but describe a problem (a<br/>difficulty you are having, etc.)<br/>* Do not use "This sucks" idiom, not even hidden in false niceties like<br/>"It's not user friendly"<br/>* Do not talk for majority, when you are not entitled to ("most users<br/>would like")<br/>* Do not consider all UX issues as minor: an inability to do stuff is<br/>not a minor issue</p></p><p><p>What is actually interesting for the designer in a report?<br/>* What were you trying to do?<br/>* Why did you want to do it?<br/>* What did you do?<br/>* What happened?<br/>* What were your expectations?</p></p><p><p>More notes<br/>* Write as much as needed<br/>* Describe what you see, did and <em>how you felt</em><br/>* Print screen is your friend!<br/>* <em>Give praise</em></p></p><p><p>== Extreme containment measures: keeping bug reports under control ==<br/>Speaker:  Jean-Francois Fortin Tam<br/>Homepage: http://jeff.ecchi.ca<br/>Twitter:  https://twitter.com/nekohayo</p></p><p><p>Discussed the problem lot of OS projects are having: lot of useless<br/>(old, irrelevant, waiting for decision no one wants to make) bug/rfe<br/>reports in their bug tracking systems. Lots of food for thought about<br/>our own projects, internal or external. Clever applications of<br/>principles from personal productivity systems such as GTD and Inbox Zero<br/>for bug tracking.</p></p><p><p>The talk was mostly an applied version of this blog post, which is worth<br/>reading:<br/>http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/10/08/reducing-our-core-apps-software-inventory/</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Petr Muller</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I particularly like the UX bug reporting guide lines. Need to take those into
account when reporting UI issues.</p>

<p>I still haven't read the second blog post which also looks interesting although
not very applicable to me. After all I'm the person reporting bugs not the one
who decides what and when gets fixed.</p>
