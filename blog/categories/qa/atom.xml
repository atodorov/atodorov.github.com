<p>Here is a quick summary of the first Fedora Test Day in Sofia I hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> today.</p>

<p>Attendance was quite poor, actually nobody else except me participated but
almost nobody else visited the hackespace as well. I get that it is a
working day and Test Days conflict with regular business hours but this
is not going to change anyway. On the other hand where were all the freelancers
and non-office job workers who usually hang around in the Lab? I have no idea!</p>

<p>On IRC there was much better activity, 5 or 6 people were testing across
Asia, Europe and USA time zones. You can see the test results
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">here</a>.
I've started filing quite a few bugs in the morning and continued well into the
afternoon. I've managed to file a total of
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1016435,1016449,1016488,1016530,1016604,1016613,1016648,1016663,1016704,1016715">10 bugs</a>.
Some of them were not related to virtualization and some of them turned out to be
duplicates or not a bug. I even managed to file 2 duplicate bugs which likely have the
same root cause myself :).</p>

<p>I've also experienced two bugs filed by other people:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967371">RHBZ #967371</a> for MATE desktop
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1015636">RHBZ #1015636</a> for
virt-manager's Save/Restore functionality.</p>

<p>I've tried ARM on x86_64 but that didn't get anywhere near a running system.
I will make another post about ARM and what I've discovered there.</p>

<p>The one thing I liked is the
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">test results application</a>.
It is not what I'm used to when dealing with RHEL, has far less features but is
very fast and easy to use and suits the Test Days participants just fine.
And is definitely much easier to use compared to filing results in the wiki.</p>

<p>Overall Fedora 20 virtualization status according to me is pretty good.</p>

<p>I hope to see more attendance <a href="http://initlab.org/event/gnome-test-day">on Thursday</a>
when we're going to test GNOME 3.10.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I <a href="/blog/2013/09/14/upcoming-talk-fedora-test-days-in-sofia/">mentioned earlier</a>
I will organize some Fedora testing in Sofia. Here's an outline of my talk this
Saturday and a general guide for anyone who wants to participate.</p>

<h2>What are Fedora Test Days</h2>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-15T10:23:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To all my readers - sorry for not being able to blog more frequently lately.
Here's an easy read about my favourite laptop brand Lenovo and some of their
design flaws I've found.</p>

<h2>X220 and T60 Batterries are ALMOST Identical</h2>

<p><img src="/images/lenovo_x220_t60_battery.jpg" title="X220 and T60 batteries" alt="&quot;X220 and T60 batteries&quot;" /></p>

<p>As you can see the <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">X220</a> and
<a href="http://amzn.to/183SgiR">T60</a> batteries are nearly identical with the notable
exception of the connector placement. The end result - I have to purchase yet another
battery as a backup for long travel/work on the go. Not what I want.</p>

<p>I wish all Lenovo models had the same batteries so people can swap them around
as they wish. Is this too much to ask for? Have you seen another brand which
got this right?</p>

<h2>ThinkPad Mini Dock Design Flaw</h2>

<p>I'm using a <a href="http://amzn.to/15tjUYi">ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</a> docking station
with my X220 laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn't quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/alone.jpg" title="docking station in position 2" alt="docking station in position 2" /></p>

<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/top.jpg" title="top view" alt="top view" />
<img src="/images/dock/back.jpg" title="back view" alt="back view" />
<img src="/images/dock/side.jpg" title="side view" alt="side view" /></p>

<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/removed.jpg" title="blocking part removed" alt="blocking part removed" /></p>

<p>Even with this piece removed my laptop still hets up too much! I guess 80 C is just
normal for the Core i7 processors :(.</p>

<p>Have you found something not quite right in your hardware design? Please share in the
comments.</p>
