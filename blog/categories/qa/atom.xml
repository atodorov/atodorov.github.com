<p><a href="http://sofiavalley.com">SofiaValley</a> recently had a bug in their UI.
As seen above when clicking the Like button the widget would overlap with
other visual elements. At first this doesn't look like a big deal but it blocks
the user from sharing the page via Facebook which is important for a blog.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/bugs/sv-bug-fixed.png" alt="SV bug fixed" style="clear:both;display:block;"/></p>

<p>I have reported the error and it was fixed very quickly. +1 for SofiaValley.</p>

<p>Have you spotted any other interesting bugs? Let me know and they will be published
here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How to compare two images in Python? A tricky question with quite a few answers.
Since my needs are simple, my solution is simpler!</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/difio_compare.png" alt="Difio Google +1 changes" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
<a href="http://www.dif.io">dif.io</a> homepage before and after it got a G+1.</p>

<h2>ImageMagic is magic</h2>

<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagic</a> then you've been
living in a cave on a deserted island! The suite contains the <code>compare</code> command
which mathematically and visually annotates the difference between two images.</p>

<p>The third image above was produced with:</p>

<pre><code>$ compare difio_10.png difio_11.png difio_diff.png
</code></pre>

<p>Differences are displayed in red (default) and the original image is seen in the
background. As shown, the Google +1 button and count has changed between the two
images. <code>compare</code> is a nice tool for manual inspection and debugging.
It works well in this case because the images are lossless PNGs and are regions of
screen shots where most objects are the same.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/chestnut_compare.jpg" alt="JPEG quality reduction" style="clear:both;display:block"/>
Chestnuts I had in Rome. 100% to 99% quality reduction.</p>

<p>As seen on the second image set only 1% of JPEG quality change leads to many small
differences in the image, which are invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Python Imaging Library aka PIL</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> is another powerful tool for
image manipulation. I googled around and found some answers to my original
questions
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1927660/compare-two-images-the-python-linux-way">here</a>.
The proposed solution is to calculate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square">RMS</a> of the two images
and compare that with some threshold to establish the level of certainty that
two images are identical.</p>

<h2>Simple solution</h2>

<p>I've been working on a script lately which needs to know what is displayed on
the screen and recognize some of the objects. Calculating image similarity is
quite complex but comparing if two images are <strong>exactly</strong> identical is not.
Given my environment and the fact
that I'm comparing screen shots where only few areas changed
(see first image above for example) led to the following solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a screen shot;</li>
<li>Crop a particular area of the image which needs to be examined;</li>
<li>Compare to a baseline image of the same area created manually;</li>
<li>Don't use RMS, use the image histogram only to speed up calculation.</li>
</ul>


<p>I've prepared the baseline images with GIMP and tested couple of scenarios
using <code>compare</code>. Here's how it looks in code:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">PIL</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Image</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">screenshot</span><span class="p">())</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">region</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">img</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">crop</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">860</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">950</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">region</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">histogram</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">baseline_histogram</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The presented solution was easy to program, works fast and reliably for my use case.
In fact after several iterations I've added a second baseline image to account for some
unidentified noise which appears randomly in the first region. As far as I can tell
the two checks combined are 100% accurate.</p>

<h2>Field of application</h2>

<p>I'm working on QA automation where this comes handy. However you may try some
lame CAPTCHA recognition by comparing regions to a pre-defined baseline. Let me know
if you come up with a cool idea or actually used this in code.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear
about interesting projects which didn't get too complicated because of image
recognition.</p>

KBGB 3864 refrigerator, caused by what looks like a race-condition.</p>

<p>This appliance starts beeping in case the door is left open for more than 60 seconds.
The alarm stops if door is closed or can be muted manually while the door is still open.</p>

<h2>The Bug</h2>

<p>It happened so that I had the door open for nearly one minute and as it was closing
I heard a beep. This time however the beeping didn't stop after the door had closed.
The alarm continued beeping with the door closed so I tried to re-open and close it again.
It didn't stop! I had to open the door and manually mute the alarm for it to stop.</p>

<div style="display:block; clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>


<h2>The Root Cause</h2>

<p>While not entirely sure, I think the reason for this malfunction
was a race-condition. The alarm went on at nearly the same time when the
controlling timer should have gone off (when closing the door).</p>

<h2>Steps To Reproduce</h2>

<p>I tried reproducing several times afterwards by opening and closing the door
at the last possible moment. I used a stop-watch to time my actions. However
I wasn't able to reproduce twice. Every time I tried, there was only one single
beep as the door was closing and no more.</p>

<p>I guess then, like we say in QE, <em>WORKS FOR ME</em>!</p>

, was not showing the caller name when a friend was calling.
The number in the contacts list was correct but the name wasn't showing,
nor the custom assigned ringing tone. It turned out to be a bug!</p>

<p>The story behind this is that accidentally the same number was saved again
in the contacts list, but without a name assigned to it.
The software was matching the later one, so no custom ringing tone,
no name shown. Removing the duplicate entry fixed the issue. Software version of this
phone is</p>

<pre><code>v 21.0.025
RM-356
02-04-09
</code></pre>

<p>I wondered what will happen with multiple duplicates and if this was fixed in a later
software version so I tested with another phone,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RXEI6U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002RXEI6U&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Nokia 6303</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002RXEI6U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
Software version is</p>

<pre><code>V 07.10
25-03-10
RM-638
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Step 0 - add the number to the contacts list, with name <code>Buddy 1</code></li>
<li>Step 1 - add the same number to the contacts, with <strong>empty name</strong>.
<strong>Result</strong>: You get a warning this number is already present for <code>Buddy 1</code>!
When receiving a call, <code>Buddy 1</code> is displayed.</li>
<li>Step 2 - edit the empty name contact and change the name to <code>Buddy 2</code>.
<strong>Result</strong>: when receiving a call <code>Buddy 2</code> is displayed.</li>
<li>Step 3 - add the same number again, with name <code>Buddy 0</code>. This is the latest entry
but it is sorted before the previous two (this is important).
<strong>Result</strong>: You get a warning that this number is already present for <code>Buddy 1</code> and <code>Buddy 2</code>.
When receiving a call <code>Buddy 0</code> is displayed.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Summary</strong>: so it looks like Nokia fixed the issue with empty names, by simply ignoring them
but when multiple duplicate contacts are available it displays the name of the last entered in the
contact list, independent of name sort order.</p>

<p><del>
Later today or tomorrow I will test on
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MOW7S2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005MOW7S2&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Nokia 700</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005MOW7S2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

<p><strong>Updated on 2013-03-19 23:50</strong></p>

<p>Finally managed to test on

<p><strong>Result</strong>: If a duplicate contact entry is present it doesn't matter if the name is empty or not.

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/02/26/performance-test-amazon-ebs-vs-instance-storage-pt1/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-26T23:02:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/02/26/performance-test-amazon-ebs-vs-instance-storage-pt1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm exploring the possibility to speed-up my cloud database so I've run some
basic tests against storage options available to Amazon EC2 instances.
The instance was <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">m1.large</a>
with High I/O performance and two additional disks with the same size:</p>

<ul>
<li>/dev/xvdb - type EBS</li>
<li>/dev/xvdc - type instance storage</li>
</ul>


<p>Both are Xen para-virtual disks. The difference is that EBS is persistent
across reboots while instance storage is ephemeral.</p>

<h2>hdparm</h2>

<p>For a quick test I used <code>hdparm</code>. The manual says:</p>

<pre><code>-T  Perform timings of cache reads for benchmark and comparison purposes.
    This displays the speed of reading directly from the Linux buffer cache
    without disk access. This measurement is essentially an indication of
    the throughput of the processor, cache, and memory of the system under test.

-t  Perform timings of device reads for benchmark and comparison purposes.
    This displays the speed of reading through the buffer cache to the disk
    without any prior caching of data. This measurement is an indication of how
    fast the drive can sustain sequential data reads under Linux, without any
    filesystem overhead.
</code></pre>

<p>The results of 3 runs of hdparm are shown below:</p>

<pre><code># hdparm -tT /dev/xvdb /dev/xvdc

/dev/xvdb:
 Timing cached reads:   11984 MB in  1.98 seconds = 6038.36 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  158 MB in  3.01 seconds =  52.52 MB/sec

/dev/xvdc:
 Timing cached reads:   11988 MB in  1.98 seconds = 6040.01 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  1810 MB in  3.00 seconds = 603.12 MB/sec


# hdparm -tT /dev/xvdb /dev/xvdc

/dev/xvdb:
 Timing cached reads:   11892 MB in  1.98 seconds = 5991.51 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  172 MB in  3.00 seconds =  57.33 MB/sec

/dev/xvdc:
 Timing cached reads:   12056 MB in  1.98 seconds = 6075.29 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  1972 MB in  3.00 seconds = 657.11 MB/sec


# hdparm -tT /dev/xvdb /dev/xvdc

/dev/xvdb:
 Timing cached reads:   11994 MB in  1.98 seconds = 6042.39 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  254 MB in  3.02 seconds =  84.14 MB/sec

/dev/xvdc:
 Timing cached reads:   11890 MB in  1.99 seconds = 5989.70 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  1962 MB in  3.00 seconds = 653.65 MB/sec
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result:</strong>
Sequential reads from instance storage are 10x faster compared to EBS on average.</p>

<h2>IOzone</h2>

<p>I'm running MySQL and sequential data reads are probably over idealistic scenario.
So I found another benchmark suite, called <a href="http://iozone.org">IOzone</a>.
I used the 3-414 version built from the official SRPM.</p>

<p>IOzone performs multiple tests. I'm interested in read/re-read, random-read/write,
read-backwards and stride-read.</p>

<p>For this round of testing I've tested with ext4 filesystem with and without journal
on both types of disks. I also experimented running Iozone inside a ramfs mounted
directory. However I didn't have the time to run the test suite multiple times.</p>

<p>Then I used
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/iozone-results-comparator/">iozone-results-comparator</a> to
visualize the results. (I had to do a minor fix to the code to run inside virtualenv
and install all missing dependencies).</p>

<p>Raw IOzone output, data visualization and the modified tools are available in the
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/atodorov/blog/aws_disk_benchmark_w_iozone.tar.bz2">aws_disk_benchmark_w_iozone.tar.bz2</a>
file (size 51M).</p>

<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>

<p>EBS without journal(Baseline) vs. Instance Storage without journal(Set1)
<img src="/images/aws_iozone/ebs_woj_vs_is_woj.png" title="EBS vs. Instance Storage" alt="EBS vs. Instance Storage" /></p>

<p>Instance Storage without journal(Baseline) vs. Ramfs(Set1)
<img src="/images/aws_iozone/ebs_woj_vs_is_woj.png" title="IS vs. Ramfs" alt="IS vs. Ramfs" /></p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ext4 journal has no effect on reads, causes slow down when writing to disk. This
is expected;</li>
<li>Instance storage is faster compared to EBS but not much.
If I understand the results correctly, read performance is similar in some cases;</li>
<li>Ramfs is definitely the fastest but read performance compared to instance storage
is not two-fold (or more) as I expected;</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Instance storage appears to be faster (and this is expected) but I'm still not sure if
my application will gain any speed improvement or how much if migrated to read from
instance storage (or ramfs) instead of EBS. I will be performing more real-world
test next time, by comparing execution time for some of my largest SQL queries.</p>

<p>If you have other ideas how to adequately measure I/O performance in the AWS cloud,
