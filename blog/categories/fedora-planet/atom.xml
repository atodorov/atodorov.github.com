    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One issue with RHEL/CentOS/Fedora on MacBook Air laptops is brightness control
and backlight behavior after suspend/resume. I've found the solution
<a href="http://mattoncloud.org/2014/02/05/fedora-20-on-a-macbook-air/">here</a>
and only tweaked it slightly for my use case.</p>

<h2>mba6x_bl doesn't load automatically</h2>

<p>The reason being the driver matches older hardware:</p>

<pre><code>$ modinfo mba6x_bl
filename:       /lib/modules/3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64/extra/mba6x_bl/mba6x_bl.ko
alias:          dmi:*:pnMacBookAir6*
license:        GPL
description:    MacBook Air 6,1 and 6,2 backlight driver
author:         Patrik Jakobsson &lt;patrik.r.jakobsson@gmail.com&gt;
rhelversion:    7.1
srcversion:     4D069C8EB0E470AF27E7F8D
depends:        video
vermagic:       3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64 SMP mod_unload modversions 
</code></pre>

<p>My system is <strong>MacBookAir7,2</strong> and doesn't match the module alias. So a
<a href="https://github.com/patjak/mba6x_bl/pull/25">quick fix</a> was needed.
For more info about <code>MODULE_ALIAS</code> see
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modalias">ArchWiki</a>.
Alternatively on Red Hat based systems you can place a config file
under <code>/etc/sysconfig/modules</code>, see
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Persistent_Module_Loading.html">the docs</a>
for more details.</p>

<h2>intel_backlight driver is in the way</h2>

<p>On older systems mba6x_bl doesn't get used automatically. The problem is the offending
intel_backlight driver which gets used instead. To workaround it add this xorg.conf snippet:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/98-mba_bl.conf
Section "Device"
    Identifier      "Intel Graphics"
    Driver          "intel"
    Option          "Backlight"     "mba6x_backlight"
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>For more info see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=989555#c19">RHBZ 989555</a>.</p>

<h2>Everything in one go</h2>

<p>If you are using RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 (version 7.1 required) instead of Fedora you can take
a look at my <a href="/blog/2015/04/29/rhel-7-repository-for-macbook-air/">Macbook Air RHEL 7 repository</a>.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-27T23:23:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/04/27/disabling-macbook-startup-sound-in-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is an easy way to disable the MacBook startup sound
(boot chime) even after wiping out OS X and installing Linux.</p>

<p>This sound can be easily disabled if you mute the volume in OS X
and shutdown the computer. The value is stored in NVRAM.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reboot the computer and hold Cmd+Alt(Option)+R. This will start
OS X Internet recovery mode;</li>
<li><p>Open the terminal and issue the following command</p>

<pre><code> nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reboot.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Voila. In Linux try this:</p>

<pre><code># efivar -l | grep SystemAudioVolume
 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolume
 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolumeDB

# efivar -n 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolume -p
GUID: 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82
Name: "SystemAudioVolume"
Attributes:
    Non-Volatile
    Boot Service Access
    Runtime Service Access
Value:
00000000  00                                                |.               |

# efivar -n 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82-SystemAudioVolumeDB -p
GUID: 7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82
Name: "SystemAudioVolumeDB"
Attributes:
    Non-Volatile
    Boot Service Access
    Runtime Service Access
Value:
00000000  00 
#
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Before disabling both variables had non zero values. Also <em>SystemAudioVolumeDB</em>
doesn't seem to have any effect.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> RHEL or CentOS users need to rebuild <em>efivar</em> from the
<a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/efivar/0.14/1.fc22/src/efivar-0.14-1.fc22.src.rpm">Fedora src.rpm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3:</strong> several Internet sources suggest that writing EFI variables from Linux
may sometimes corrupt your Apple firmware. I didn't research this any further. If you
happen to figure out how to successfully write to these variables under Linux please let
everyone know in the comments (in case OS X recovery mode goes missing, you know).</p>

<p>Thanks to my reader Alexander, who
<a href="/blog/2015/04/26/installing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-on-macbook-air-2015/#disqus_thread">gave me the hint</a>
in a previous blog post.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/04/27/compiling-broadcom-wl-kmod-wifi-driver-for-rhel-7/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-27T12:17:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/04/27/compiling-broadcom-wl-kmod-wifi-driver-for-rhel-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I got my
<a href="/blog/2015/04/26/installing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-on-macbook-air-2015/">MacBook Air installed with RHEL 7.1</a>
the first priority was getting wireless working.
First check if your device isn't already supported
<a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43/#Supported_devices">upstream</a>. Mine isn't</p>

<pre><code>14e4:43a0: Broadcom Corporation BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)
</code></pre>

<p>Next grab the src.rpm files necessary to build the <em>wl</em> driver from RPM Fusion.
For <code>akmods-0.5.2-1.fc21.src.rpm</code>, <code>broadcom-wl-6.30.223.248-2.fc21.src.rpm</code>,
<code>kmodtool-1-23.fc20.src.rpm</code> just execute <em>rpmbuild --rebuild</em> against each file
and install <code>kmodtool</code> and <code>akmods</code>.</p>

<p>Then you need two more files <code>buildsys-build-rpmfusion</code> and <code>wl-kmod</code>.
The first one is a helper tool containing list of recent kernels to build against,
the later one is the driver source itself. Both needed minor modifications before
building on RHEL 7.</p>

<p>I've created my own
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/buildsys-build-rpmfusion-for-rhel7">buildsys-build-rpmfusion</a> package listing the current kernels
for RHEL 7.1. For <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/wl-kmod-for-rhel7">wl-kmod</a> I've introduced a
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/wl-kmod-for-rhel7/blob/master/wl-kmod-100_redhat.patch">patch</a>
which modifies the other patches in the package so it builds correctly on 7.1.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't know if there's a define which can be used to detect if we're building
on RHEL (maybe I can define my own) but direct kernel version number comparison doesn't
work here because Red Hat backports chosen functionality from more recent kernels without
changing the version number. This approach may not be the best one but I've tried to keep it clean
for easier maintenance in the future and it got me started very quickly.</p>

<p>Build the modified buildsys-build-rpmfusion and:</p>

<pre><code>yum install buildsys-build-rpmfusion-7-1.x86_64.rpm buildsys-build-rpmfusion-kerneldevpkgs-current-7-1.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>Build the wl-kmod package and:</p>

<pre><code>yum install akmod-wl-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm broadcom-wl-6.30.223.248-2.el7.noarch.rpm kmod-wl-3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm kmod-wl-6.30.223.248-5.el7.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>If necessary re-create your initramfs image to include <em>wl.ko</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've upgraded to a new
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UGECEUY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00UGECEUY&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=3YENGI5TIYKEC5GM">MacBook Air</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UGECEUY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
(13 inch, early 2015) laptop and luckily enough I'm running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 on it. Here is how to install it.</p>

<h2>Prepare boot media</h2>

<p>The easiest method is to boot from a USB stick which holds
either the entire DVD or just boot.iso. Since I happened to find a 1GB only USB stick I
went for the boot.iso. <code>dd if=boot.iso of=/dev/sdb</code> is the only thing you need to prepare
the boot media.</p>

<h2>Initial boot</h2>

<p><img src="/images/mac/boot_menu.jpg" title="Mac boot menu" alt="Mac boot menu" /></p>

<p>While computer is booting hold the (left) Alt (Option) key to enter <em>Startup Manager</em>.
Wait a second or two before it displays your local hard drive and the USB boot media.
Select the option <em>EFI boot</em> to boot the anaconda installer.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Booting from a boot.iso means I need to use the network to grab the rest of the installation.
Because the wireless card needs proprietary drivers
I've tried both USB to Ethernet adapter and USB tethering with my phone.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> initially I have forgotten to plug in my USB networking card which resulted in
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1191286">bug #1191286</a>. After cold-plugging and
rebooting the system everything was fine. Subsequently I don't see any problems with the
USB networking card. The bug should be fixed in RHEL 7.2 btw.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've been using a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PONXAI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002PONXAI&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=N4KGQKYSBSDWMMM6">USB docking station from Plugable</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002PONXAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
for years because their products are Linux friendly. In particular the networking chip is ASIX and
there is no problems with drivers for Linux.</p>

<p>In my case I've wiped out the entire SSD disk b/c I don't care about dual boot.
Previously I've heard about anaconda crashing while it tries to detect the Mac OS file system.
I've played around with Rawhide before going for RHEL 7.1 and didn't see any problems related to
foreign filesystems.</p>

<p>I've gone with the default partitioning scheme while slightly modifing the partition sizes, etc.</p>

<h2>Post install</h2>

<p>There are several issues which still need attention. I didn't have enough time in the last few
days to check these out:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 sucks big time. Fortunately I was able to install MATE Desktop from EPEL;</li>
<li>Wireless card needs drivers; I've managed to compile them myself,
<a href="/blog/2015/04/27/compiling-broadcom-wl-kmod-wifi-driver-for-rhel-7/">see here</a>;</li>
<li>Display brightness doesn't seem to work at all. On top of that the display goes full black
after suspend-resume. I could barely see anything on it.
<a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2015/04/29/fixing-display-brightness-on-macbook-air-with-rhel-7/">Fixed here</a>!</li>
<li>There is a very annoying boot chime <strike>which I have no idea how to disable</strike>
<a href="/blog/2015/04/27/disabling-macbook-startup-sound-in-linux/">Fixed here</a>;</li>
<li>The onboard keyboard is quite annoying for previous ThinkPad user like myself. Most
importantly I need to press Fn to activate the F1, F2, etc keys which I use a lot in mcedit.
I'll share more info after I figure out how to remap the keyboard;</li>
<li>I do have a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter and hot-plug seems to work (at least partially)
despite claims that this is not supported in Linux;</li>
<li>Power manager was reporting my battery life totally wrong but after a full discharge/recharge
it seems to have calibrated itself;</li>
<li>Output sound works out of the box, haven't tested camera and microphone input yet;</li>
<li>ATrpms and EPEL are still missing some codecs for RHEL 7 which means no movies;</li>
<li>Fan speed needs adjustments;</li>
<li>I have not yet tested presenting via projector but already have a few ideas how to make it work;</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-04-28:</strong>
Check the list above for links to wifi and backlight drivers and how to disable the boot chime.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2015-04-29:</strong>
You can find precompiled RPMS in my
<a href="/blog/2015/04/29/rhel-7-repository-for-macbook-air/">Macbook Air RHEL 7 repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Fedora 22 on MacBook Air</h2>

<p>I did try Fedora 22 Beta and experienced
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215458">bug #1215458</a>.
Also for some reason the installation hit an error downloading a package and didn't let me retry
but forced me to exit the process.</p>

<p>I'll continue posting my updates until the system runs smoothly like it is supposed to.</p>
