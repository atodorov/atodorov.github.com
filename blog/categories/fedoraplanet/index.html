                    A 5 year old girl vs. CoderDojo
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="Adi @ Hello Ruby" src="/images/adi_hello_ruby_twitter.jpg" title="Adi @ Hello Ruby" /></p>
<p>In early December'16 together with my 5 year old daughter we visited an introductory workshop
about the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD">Hello Ruby</a> book and another
workshop organized by <a href="http://coderdojobulgaria.com/">Coder Dojo Bulgaria</a>.
Later that month we also visited a <a href="http://www.roboleague.bg/">Robo League</a>
competition in Sofia.
The goal was to further Adriana's interest into technical topics and programming in
particular and see how she will respond to the topics covered and the
workshops and training materials format in general. I have been keeping
detailed notes and today I'm publishing some of my observations.</p>
<p>The events that we visited were strictly for small children and there were mentors
who worked with the kids. Each mentor, depending on the event works with up to 4 or 5
children. Parents were not allowed to interfere and I have been keeping
my distance on purpose, trying to observe and document as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Hello Ruby</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD">Hello Ruby</a> is a small book with colorful illustrations
about a girl who embarks on adventures in programming. Adriana considers it a fairy tale
although the book introduces lots of IT related terms - Ruby and gems, Firefox,
Snow Leopard, Django, etc. For a child these don't necessarily mean anything
but she was able to recognize my Red Hat fedora which was depicted on one of the pages.</p>
<p>The workshop itself was the introduction of the Bulgarian translation, which I've purchased,
and had the kids build a laptop using glue and paper icons. Mentors were explaining
to the children what the various icons mean, that viruses are a bad thing for your computer,
what a CPU and computer memory are
and everything else in between. A month later when Adriana started building a new
paper computer on her own (without being provoked by me) she told me that the
colored icons were "information" that goes into the computer!</p>
<p>After the story part of the book there are exercises designed to create analytical
thinking. We did only a few in the beginning where she had to create a list of
action sequence how to make the bed or get dressed up in the morning, etc. At the time
Adriana didn't receive the game very well and was having some troubles figuring out
the smaller actions that comprise a larger activity. We didn't follow through with
the game.</p>
<h2>Code.org</h2>
<p>At the second event she was exposed to <a href="https://studio.code.org/">studio.code.org</a>!
At the time we were required to bring a working laptop and a mouse. I had no idea
how these were going to be used. It turned out mentors gave each child a training
course from code.org according to their age. Adriana started with the Course #1
because she can't read on her own!</p>
<p>At first it seemed to me that Adi was a bit bored and didn't know what to do,
staring cluelessly at the screen. Btw this was her first session working with
a computer on her own. After a while the mentor came and I guess explained what
needs to be done, how the controls work and what the objective of the exercise was.
After that I noticed she's working more independently and grew interested in the
subject. She had a problem working with the mouse and after 2 days I've nudged
her to use the TrackPoint and mouse buttons on a ThinkPad laptop. She uses them
with both hands, so am I btw, and is much more adept at controlling the cursor
that way. If you are going to teach children how to work effectively with a computer
you may as well start with teaching them to work effectively with a track pad!</p>
<p>The courses are comprised of games and puzzles (which she's very good at)
asking children to perform a very basic programming concept. For example instruct
an angry bird to move left or right by using blocks for each instruction.
By the time the workshop was over Adriana had completed 4 levels on her own.</p>
<p>Level 5 introduced a button for step-by-step execution of the program also
colloquially known as debugging :). The first few exercises she had no idea
what to do with this debugging button. Then the 6th exercise introduced a
wrong starting sequence and everything snapped into place.</p>
<p>Level 7 introduced additional instructions. There are move left/right instructions
as well as visit a flower and make honey instruction. This level also introduces
repeating instructions, for example make honey 2 times. At first that was confusing
but then she started to take a notice at the numbers shown on screen and started to
figure out how to build the proper sequence of blocks to complete the game.
When she made mistakes she used the debugging button to figure out which block
was not in place and remove it.</p>
<p>After this level Adi started making more mistakes, but more importantly she also
started trying to figure them out on her own. My help was limited to asking
questions like "what do you need to do", "where are you at the screen now",
"what instructions do you need to execute to get where you want to be".</p>
<p>Level 8 introduces a new type of game, drawing shapes on the screen. The hardest
part here is that you need to jump from one node to another sometimes. This
is great for improving the child spatial orientation skills.</p>
<p>Level 11 is a reading game in English. You need to instruct a bee to fly across
different letters to complete a word shown on the screen. However Adriana can't
read much less in English, although she understands and speaks English
well for her age. In this case I believe she relied on pattern recognition
to complete all exercises in this level. She would look at the target word
and then identify the letters on the playing board. Next she would stack instruction
blocks to program the movements of the bee towards her goal as in previous exercises.</p>
<p>Level 13 introduces loops. It took Adriana 7 exercises to figure out what a loop
is, identify the various elements of it and how to construct it properly.
She also said that was amusing to her. Almost immediately she was able to identify
the length of the loop by herself and construct loops with only 1 block inside
their body. Loops with 2 or more blocks inside their body were a bit harder.</p>
<p>Level 14 introduced nested loops, usually one or more instruction blocks paired
with a loop block, nested inside another loop block. For example:
<code>repeat 3 times(move left, repeat 2 times(move down))</code>. Again it took her about 6
exercises to figure them out. This is roughly at the middle of the level.</p>
<p>Level 16 was quite hard. It had blocks with parameters where you have to type
in some words and animal characters will "speak these words" as if in a comic book.
I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a text to speech engine integrated for
this level but sounds like a good idea. Anyhow this level was not on-par with
her skills.</p>
<p>The course completed with free range drawing using instruction blocks and cycles.
The image she drew was actually her name where she had to guess how much scribbles
the painter needs to do in one direction, then traverse back and go into another direction.
She also had to figure out how big each letter needs to be so that it is possible to
actually draw it given the game limitations in motion and directions. This final level
required lot of my help.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I have never had any doubts that small children are very clever and
capable of understanding enormous amounts of information and new concepts.
However I'm amazed by how deep their understanding goes and how fast they
are able to apply the new things they learn.</p>
<p>Through games and practical workshops I believe it is very easy to teach
children to gain valuable skills for engineering professions. Even if they
don't end up in engineering the ability to clearly define goals and instructions,
break down complex tasks into small chunks and clearly communicate intentions
is a great advantage. So is the ability to analyze the task on your own and
use simple building blocks to achieve larger objectives.</p>
<p>I will continue to keep notes on Adi's progress but will very likely write
about it less frequently. If you do have small children around you please
introduce them to <a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD">Hello Ruby</a> and
<a href="https://studio.code.org/">studio.code.org</a> and help them learn!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Due to popular demand I'm sharing my plans for the upcoming conference season.
Here is a list of events I plan to visit and speak at (hopefully). The list
will be updated throughout the year so please subscribe to the comments section
to receive a notification when that happens! I'm open to meeting new people so
ping me for a beer if you are attending some of these events!</p>
<h2>02 February - Hack Belgium Pre-Event Workshops, Brussels</h2>
<p><strong>Note: added on Jan 12th</strong></p>
<p>Last year I had an amazing time visiting an
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">Elixir &amp; Erlang workshop</a> so
I'm about to repeat the experience. I will be visiting a
<a href="http://www.hackathon.com/event/hack-belgium-pre-event-workshops-29372270251">workshop</a>
organized by HackBelgium and keep you posted with the results.</p>
<h2>03 February - Git Merge, Brussels</h2>
<p><strong>Note: added on Jan 12th</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://git-merge.com/">Git Merge</a> is organized by GitHub and will be held in Brussels
this year. I will be visiting only the conference track and giving a lightning talk
titled <em>Automatic upstream dependency testing with GitHub API</em>! That and the afterparty
of course!</p>
<h2>04-05 February - FOSDEM, Brussels</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/">FOSDEM</a> is the largest free and open source gathering
in Europe which I have been visiting since 2009 (IIRC). You can checkout some
of my reports about
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-1-python-stands-lightning-talks/">FOSDEM 2014, Day 1</a>,
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/">FOSDEM 2014, Day 2</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">FOSDEM 2016</a>.</p>
<p>I will present my
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/mutant_testing/">Mutants, tests and zombies</a>
talk at the <em>Testing &amp; Automation devroom</em> on Sunday. With a bit more luck I may be
presenting a second talk at the <em>Python devroom</em> on Saturday!</p>
<p>I will be in Brussels between February 1st and 5th to explore the local
start-up scene and get to meet with the Python community so ping me if you are around.</p>
<h2>18 March - QA Challenge Accepted 3.0, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="http://qachallengeaccepted.com/">QA: Challenge Accepted</a> is a specialized QA conference
in Sofia and most of the sessions are in Bulgarian. I've visited last year and it was great.
I even proposed a <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/03/25/hello-world-qa-challenge/">challenge of my own</a>.</p>
<p>CFP is still open but I have a strong confidence that my talk
<em>Testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux the MicroSoft way</em> will be approved. It will describe
a large scale experiment with pairwise testing, which btw I learned about at
QA: Challenge Accepted 2.0 :).</p>
<h2>07-08 April - Bulgaria Web Summit, Sofia</h2>
<p>I have been a moderator at
<a href="https://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a> for several years and this year
is no exception. This is one of the strongest events held in Sofia and is in English.
Last year over 60% of the attendees were from abroad so you are welcome!</p>
<p>I'm not going to speak at this event but will record as much of it
as possible. Checkout earlier recordings on my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">YouTube</a> channel
and hurry up because tickets are almost sold out!</p>
<h2>10-12 May - Romanian Testing Conference, Cluj-Napoca</h2>
<p><a href="http://romaniatesting.ro/">RTC'17</a> is a new event I found in neighboring Romania.
The topic this year is <em>Thriving and remaining relevant in Quality Assurance</em>. My talk is titled
<em>Quality Assistance in the Brave New World</em> where I'll share some experiences
and visions for the QA profession.</p>
<p>As it turned out I know a few people living in Cluj so I'll be arriving one day earlier
on May 9th to meet the locals.</p>
<h2>13-15 May - OSCAL, Tirana</h2>
<p><a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/">Open Source Conference Albania</a> is the largest OSS event in
the country. I'm on a row here to explore the IT scene on the Balkans. Due to traveling
constraints my availability will be limited to the conference venue only but I've booked
a hotel across the street :).</p>
<p>I will be meeting a few friends in Tirana and hear about the progress of an
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/21/women-in-open-source/">psychological experiment</a> we devised
with Jona Azizaj and Suela Palushi.</p>
<p>Talking wise I'm hoping to get the chance of introducing mutation testing and
even host a workshop on the topic.</p>
<h2>20-21 May - DEVit, Thessaloniki</h2>
<p>This is the 3rd edition of <a href="http://devitconf.org/">DEVit</a>,
the 360° web development conference of Northern Greece. I've been a regular
visitor since the beginning and this year I've proposed a session on mutation
testing. Because the Thessaloniki community seems more interested in Ruby and Rails
my goal is to share more examples from my Ruby work and compare how that is different
from the Python world. There is once again an opportunity for a workshop.</p>
<p>So far I've been the only Bulgarian to visit DEVit and also locally known as
"The guy who Kosta &amp; Kosta met in Sofia"! Checkout my impressions from
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/05/22/devit-conf-2015-impressions/">DEVit'15</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/05/25/devit-conf-2016/">DEVit'16</a>
if you are still wondering whether to attend or not! I strongly recommend it!</p>
<h2>01-02 June - Shift Developer Conference, Split</h2>
<p><a href="http://shift.codeanywhere.com/">Shift</a> appears to be a very big event in Croatia.
My attendance is still unconfirmed due to lots of traveling before that and
the general trouble of efficiently traveling on the Balkans. However I have a
CFP submitted and waiting for approval. This time it is my
<em>Mutation Testing in Patterns</em>, which is a journal of different code patterns
found during mutation testing. I have not yet presented it to the public
but will blog about it sometime soon so stay tuned.</p>
<h2>July - TuxCon, Plovdiv</h2>
<p><a href="http://tuxcon.mobi/">TuxCon</a> is held in Plovdiv around the beginning of July.
I'm usually presenting some lightning talks there and use the opportunity to
meet with friends and peers outside Sofia and catch up with news from the
local community. The conference is in Bulgarian with the exception of the
occasional foreign speaker. If you understand Bulgarian I recommend the
story of
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/07/12/testing-the-8-bit-computer-puldin/">Puldin - a Bulgarian computer from the 80s</a>.</p>
<h2>September or October - SEETEST, The Balkans</h2>
<p><a href="http://seetest.org">South East European Software Testing Conference</a> is, AFAIK,
an international event which is hosted in a major city on the Balkans. Last year it was
held in Bucharest with previous years held in Sofia.</p>
<p>In my view this is the most formal event, especially related to software testing,
I'm about to visit. Nevertheless I like to hear about new ideas and some research
in the field of QA so this is a good opportunity. I'm not planning to speak at
this event!</p>
<h2>October - HackConf, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="https://hackconf.bg">HackConf</a> is one of the largest conferences in Bulgaria, gathering
over 1000 people each year. I am strongly affiliated with the people who organize it
and even had the opportunity to host the opening session last year. The picture above
is from this event.</p>
<p>The audience is still very young and inexperienced but the presenters are above average.
Organizers' goal is HackConf to become the strongest technical conference in the country
and also serve as a sort of inspiration for young IT professionals.</p>
<p>Each year the conference has a topic and I have no idea what the topic for 2017 will be.
In any case I think I will have something interesting to share with the public.</p>
<h2>October - IT Weekend, Bulgaria</h2>
<p><a href="http://it-weekend.com/">IT Weekend</a> is organized by Petar Sabev, the same person who's
behind QA: Challenge Accepted. It is a non-formal gathering of engineers with the intent
to share some news and then discuss and share problems and experiences. Checkout my
review of
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/">IT Weekend #1</a> and
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/02/it-weekend-highlights/">IT Weekend #3</a>.</p>
<p>The topic revolve around QA, leadership and management but the format is open and the
intention is to broaden the topics covered. The event is held outside Sofia at a SPA
hotel and makes for a very nice retreat. I don't have a topic but I'm definitely going
if time allows. I will probably make something up if we have QA slots available :).</p>
<h2>October - Software Freedom Kosova, Prishtina</h2>
<p><a href="http://sfk.flossk.org">Software Freedom Kosova</a> is one of the oldest conferences
about free and open source software in the region.
This is part of my goal to explore the IT communities on the Balkans.
Kosovo sounds a bit strange to visit but I did recognize a few names on the speaker
list of previous years.</p>
<p>The CFP is not open yet but I'm planning to make a presentation. Also if weather
allows I'm planning a road trip on my motorbike :).</p>
<h2>November - ISTA Con, Sofia</h2>
<p><a href="https://istacon.org/">Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation</a> started as a QA conference
several years ago but it has broaden the range of acceptable topics to include
development, devops and agile. I was at the first two editions and then didn't attend
for a while until <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/30/highlights-from-ista-and-gtac-2016/">last year</a> when I
really liked it. The event is entirely in English with lots of foreign speakers.</p>
<p>Recently I've been working on something I call "Regression Test Monitoring" and my
intention is to present this at ISTA 2017 so stay tuned.</p>
<h2>November - Google Test Automation Conference, London</h2>
<p>There are no dates announced for
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/">GTAC 2017</a>
but it will be held in London. Both speakers and attendees are pre-approved
and my goal is to be the second Bulgarian to speak at GTAC.</p>
<p>The previous two years saw talks about
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/">mutation testing vs. coverage</a>
and their respective use
to determine the quality of a test suite with both parties arguing against
each other. Since I'm working in both of these fields and have at least one
practical example I'm trying to gather more information and present my findings
to the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and see you around!</p>

                <p><img alt="QA 101 graduation" src="/images/qa101_final.jpg" title="QA 101 graduation" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of this year I've hosted the first QA related course at
<a href="http://hackbulgaria.com/">HackBulgaria</a>. This is a long overdue post about
how the course went, what worked well and what didn't. Brace yourself because
it is going to be a long one.</p>
<p>The idea behind a QA course has been lurking in both RadoRado's (from HackBulgaria)
and my heads for quite a while. We've been discussing it at least a year before we
actually started. One day Rado told me he'd found a sponsor and we have the go ahead
for the course and that's how it all started!</p>
<p>The first issue was that we weren't prepared to start at a moments notice. I literally
had two weeks to prepare
<a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101">the curriculum</a>
and <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/12/how-to-hire-software-testers-pt-1/">initial interview questions</a>.
Next we opened the application form and left it open until the last possible moment.
I've been reviewing candidate answers hours before the course started, which was
another mistake we made!</p>
<p>On the positive side is that I hosted a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgu0VTxytYw&amp;index=37&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">Q&amp;A session on YouTube</a>
answering general questions about the profession and the course itself. This
live stream helped popularize the course.</p>
<p>At the start we had 30 people and around 13 of them managed to "graduate"
till the final lesson. The biggest portion of students dropped out after the
first 5 lessons of Java crash course! Each lesson was around 4 hours with 20-30
minutes break in the middle.</p>
<p>With respect to the criteria find a first job or find a new/better job I consider the
training successful. To my knowledge all students have found better jobs, many of them
as software testers!</p>
<p>On the practical side of things students managed to find and report 11 interesting
bugs against Fedora. Mind you that these were all found in the wild:
<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5323">fedora-infrastructure #5323</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339701">RHBZ#1339701</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339709">RHBZ#1339709</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339713">RHBZ#1339713</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339719">RHBZ#1339719</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339731">RHBZ#1339731</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339739">RHBZ#1339739</a>,

<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340891">RHBZ#1340891</a>.</p>
<p>Then students also made a few pull requests on GitHub (3 which I know off):
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-math/pull/38">commons-math #38</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-csv/pull/12">commons-csv #12</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-email/pull/1">commons-email #1</a>.</p>
<h2>Lesson format</h2>
<p>For reference most lessons were a mix of short presentation about theory and best practices
followed by discussions and where appropriate practical sessions with technology or
projects. The exercises were designed for individual work, work in pairs or small groups (4-5)
on purpose.</p>
<p>By request from the sponsors I've tried to keep a detailed record of each student's
performance and personality traits as much as I was able to observe them. I really enjoyed
keeping such a journal but didn't share this info with my students which I consider
a negative issue. I think knowing where your strong and weak areas are would help you
become a better expert in your field!</p>
<h2>Feedback from students</h2>
<ul>
<li>There was little time (to work on the practical examples I guess);</li>
<li>Not having particular practical tasks was a problem. For example we didn't have tasks of the
sort do "X" then "Y";</li>
<li>They needed more time and more attention to be given to them;</li>
<li>Installing different pieces of software and tools took a lot of time and frustration.
It was also quite problematic sometimes depending on whether they used Linux, Windows or Mac OS X;</li>
<li>Working with Eclipse IDE was horrible. Nobody new what to do and the interface
wasn't newbie friendly. Also it took quite a lot of time to install dependencies and/or
import projects to run in Eclipse;</li>
<li>There were a few problems with Selenium and its different versions being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to point out that while these are valid concerns and major issues students were
at least partially guilty for the last 3 of them. It was my impression that most of them
didn't prepare at home, didn't read the next lesson and didn't install prerequisite
tools and software!</p>
<h2>5x Java Crash Course</h2>
<p>We've started with a Java crash course as requested by our sponsors which was extended to
5 instead of the original 3 sessions. RadoRado was teaching Java fundamentals while
I was assisting him with comments.</p>
<p>On the good side is that Rado explains very well and in much details. He also writes code
to demonstrate what he teaches and while doing so uses only the knowledge he's presented
so far. For example if there's a repeating logic/functionality he would just write it
twice instead of refactoring that into a separate function with parameters (assuming
the students have not learned about functions yet). I think this made it more easier
to understand the concepts being taught.</p>
<p>Another positive thing we did was me going behind Rado's computer and modifying some
of the code while he was explaining something on screen. If you take the above example
and have two methods with print out salutations, e.g. "Good morning, Alex" I would go
and modify one of them to include "Mr." while the other will not. This introduced a
change in behavior which ultimately results in a bug! This was a nice practical way
to demonstrate how some classes of bugs get introduced in reality. We did only a few of
these behind the computer changes and I definitely liked them! They were all ad-hoc,
not planned for.</p>
<p>On the negative side Java seems hard to learn and after these 5 lessons half of the
students dropped out. Maybe part of the reason is they didn't expect to start a QA
course with lessons about programming. But that also means they didn't pay enough
attention to the curriculum, which was announced in advance!</p>
<h2>Lesson 01 - QA Fundamentals</h2>
<p>I had made a point to assign time constraints to each exercise in the lessons.
While that mostly worked in the first few lessons, where there is more theory,
we didn't keep the schedule and were overtime.</p>
<p>Explaining testing theory (based on ISTQB fundamentals) took longer than I expected.
it was also evident that we needed more written examples of what different test
analysis techniques are (e.g. boundary value analysis). Here Petar Sabev helped
me deliver few very nice examples.</p>
<p>One of the exercises was "when to stop testing" with an example of a Sudoku solving
function and different environments in which this code operates, e.g. browser, mobile,
etc. Students appeared to have a hard time understanding what a
"runtime environment" is and define relevant tests based on that! I believe most
of the students, due to lack of knowledge and experience, were also having a hard time grasping the
concept of non-functional testing.</p>
<p>A positive thing was that students started explaining to one another and giving
examples for bugs they've seen outside the course.</p>
<h2>Lesson 02 - Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<p>This lesson was designed as role playing game to demonstrate the most common
software development methodologies - waterfall and agile and discuss the QA role
in both of them. The format by itself is very hard to conduct successfully and
this was my first time ever doing this. I've also never taken part of such games
until then, only heard about them.</p>
<p>During the waterfall exercise it was harder for the students to follow the game
constraints and not exchange information with one another because they were sitting
on the same table.</p>
<p>On the positive side all groups came with unique ideas about software features and how
they want to develop them. Timewise we managed to do very well. On the negative side
is that I was the client for all groups and didn't manage to pay enough attention
to everyone, which btw is what clients usually do in real life.</p>
<h2>Lesson 03 - Bug Tracking</h2>
<p>This lesson was a practical exercise in writing bug reports and figuring out what
information needs to be present in a good bug report. Btw this is something I
always ask junior members at job interviews.</p>
<p>First we started with working in pairs to define what a good bug report is
without actually knowing what that means. Students found it hard to brainstorm
together and most of them worked alone during this exercise.</p>
<p>Next students had to write bug reports for some example bugs, which I've explained briefly
on purpose and perform peer reviews of their bugs. Reviews took a long time to complete
but overall students had a good idea of what information to include in a bug report.</p>
<p>Then, after learning from their mistakes and hearing what others had done, they've
learned about some good practices and were tasked to rewrite their bug reports using
the new knowledge. I really like the approach of letting students make some mistakes
and then showing them the easier/better way of doing things. This is also on-par with
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/">Ivan Nemytchenko's methodology</a> of
letting his interns learn by their mistakes.</p>
<p>All bug reports can be found in students repositories, which are forked from the
curriculum. Check out <a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network">https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network</a>.</p>
<p>I should have really asked everyone to file bugs under the curriculum repository so
it is easier for me to track them. On the other hand I wanted each student to start building
their own public profile to show potential employers.</p>
<h2>Lesson 04 - Test Case Management</h2>
<p>This lesson started with an exercise asking students to create accounts for
Red Hat's OpenShift cloud platform in the form of a test scenario. The scenario intentionally
left out some details. The idea being that missing information introduces inconsistencies
during testing and to demonstrate how the same steps were performed slightly differently.</p>
<p>We had some troubles explaining exactly "how did you test" because most inexperienced people
would not remember all details about where they clicked, did they use the mouse or the
keyboard, was the tab order correct, etc. Regardless students managed to receive different
results and discover that some email providers were not supported.</p>
<p>The homework assignment was to create test plans and test cases in Nitrate at
<a href="https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/">https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/</a>. Unfortunately the system appears to be down ATM
and I don't have time to investigate why. This piece of infrastructure was put together
in 2 hours and I'm surprised it lasted without issues during the entire course.</p>
<h2>2x Introduction to Linux</h2>
<p>This was a crash course in Linux fundamentals and exercise with most common commands
and text editors in the console. Most of the students were not prepared with virtual
machines. We've also used a cloud provider to give students remote shell but the
provider API was failing and we had to deploy docker containers manually. Overall
infrastructure was a big problem but we somehow managed. Another problem was with
ssh clients from Windows who generated keys in a format that our cloud provider
couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Wrt commands and exercises students did well and managed to execute most of them
on their own. That's very good for people who've never seen a terminal in their lives
(more or less).</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Testing Fedora 24(25) Changes</h2>
<p>Once again nobody was prepared with a virtual machine with Fedora and students
were installing software as we go. Because of that we didn't manage to conduct
the lesson properly and had to repeat it on the next session.</p>
<p>Rawhide being the bleeding edge of Fedora means it is full of bugs. Well I couldn't
keep up with everyone and explain workarounds or how to install/upgrade Fedora.
That was a major setback. It also became evident that you can't move quickly
if you have no idea what to do and no instructions about it either.</p>
<h2>Lesson 05 - Again</h2>
<p>Once prepared with the latest and greatest from Rawhide the task was to analyze the
proposed feature changes (on the Fedora wiki) and create test plans and design
test cases for said changes. Then execute the tests in search for bugs. This is where
some of the bugs above came from. The rest were found during upgrades.</p>
<p>This lesson was team work (4-5 students) but the results were mixed. IMO Fedora changes
are quite hard to grasp, especially if you lack domain knowledge and broader knowledge
about the structure and operation of a Linux distribution. I don't think most teams
were able to clearly understand their chosen features and successfully create good
plans/scenarios for them. On the other hand in real life software you don't necessarily
understand the domain better and know what to do. I've been in situations where
whole features have been defined by a single sentence and requested to be tested by QA.</p>
<p>One of the teams didn't manage to install Fedora (IIRC they didn't have laptops
capable of running a VM) and were not able to conduct the exercise.</p>
<p>Being able to find real life bugs, some of them serious, and getting traction in Bugzilla
is the most positive effect of this lesson. I personally wanted to have more output
(e.g. more bugs, more cases defined, etc) but taking into account the blocking factors
and setbacks I think this is a good initial result.</p>
<h2>Lesson 06 - Unit Testing and Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Here we had a few examples of bad stubs and mocks which were not received very well.
The topic is hard in itself and wasn't very well explained with practical examples.</p>
<p>Another negative thing is that students took a lot of time to fiddle around with
Eclipse, they were mistyping commands in the terminal and generally not paying enough
attention to instructions. This caused the exercises to go slowly.</p>
<p>We've had an exercise which asks the student to write a new test for a non-existing
method. Then implement the method and make sure all the tests passed. You guessed it
this is Test Driven Development.
IIRC one of the students was having a hard time with that exercise so I popped up
my editor on the large screen and started typing what she told me, then re-running the
tests and asking her to show me the errors I've made and tell me how to correct them.
The exercise was received very well and was fun to do.</p>
<p>Due to lack of time we had to go over TravisCI very quickly. The other bad thing about
TravisCI is that it requires git/GitHub and the students were generally inexperienced
with that. Both GitHub for Windows and Mac OS suck a big time IMO. What you need is the
console. However none of the students had any practical experience with git and knew
how to commit code and push branches to GitHub. git fundamentals however is a separate
one or two lessons by itself which we didn't do.</p>
<h2>Lesson 07 - Writing JUnit tests for Apache Commons</h2>
<p>Excluding the problems with Eclipse and the GitHub desktop client and
missing instructions for Windows the hardest part of this lesson was actually
selecting a component to work on, understanding what the code does and actually
writing meaningful tests. On top of that most students were not very proficient
programmers and Java was completely new to them.</p>
<p>Despite having 3 pull requests on GitHub I consider this lesson to be a failure.</p>
<h2>Lesson 08 - Integration Testing with Selenium</h2>
<p>This lesson starts with an example of what a flaky test it. At the moment I don't
think this lesson is the best place for that example. To make things even more difficult
the example is in Python (because that way was the easiest for me to write it) instead
of Java. Students had problems installing Python on Windows just to make this example work.
They also were lacking the knowledge how to execute a script in the terminal.</p>
<p>One of the students proposed a better flaky example utilizing dates and times and
executing it during various hours of the day. I have yet to code this and
prepare environment in which it would be executed. Btw recently I've seen similar behavior
caused by inconsistent timezone usage in Ruby which resulted in unexpected time offset
a little after midnight :).</p>
<p>Once again I have to point out that students came generally unprepared for the lesson
and haven't installed prerequisite software and programming languages. This is becoming
a trend and needs to be split out into a preparation session, possibly with a check
list.</p>
<p>On the Selenium side, starting with Selenium IDE, it was a bit unclear how to use it
and what needs to be done. This is another negative trend, where students were missing clear
instructions what they are expected to do. At the end we did resort to live demo
using Selenium IDE so they can at least get some idea about it.</p>
<h2>Lesson 09 and 10 - Writing Selenium tests for Mozilla Add-ons website</h2>
<p>IMO these two lessons are the biggest disaster of the entire course. Python &amp; virtualenv
on Windows was a total no go but on Linux things weren't much easier because students
had no idea what a virtualenv is.</p>
<p>Practice wise they haven't managed to read all the bugs on the Mozilla bug tracker and
had a very hard time selecting bugs to write tests for. Not to mention that many of the
reported bugs were administrative tasks to create or remove add-on categories. There
weren't many functional related bugs to write tests for.</p>
<p>The product under test was also hard to understand and most students were seeing it for the first
time, let alone getting to know the devel and testing environments that Mozilla provides.
Mozilla's test suite being in Python is just another issue to make contribution harder
because we've never actually studied Python.</p>
<p>Between the two lessons there were students who've missed the Selenium introduction
lesson and were having even harder time to figure things out. I didn't have the time
to explain and go back to the previous lesson for them.
Maybe an attendance policy is needed for dependent lessons.</p>
<p>Before the course started I've talked to some guys at Mozilla's IRC channel and
they agreed to help but at the end we didn't even engage with them. At this point
I'm skeptical that mentoring over IRC would have worked anyway.</p>
<h2>Lesson 11 - Introduction to Performance Testing</h2>
<p>This was a more theoretical lesson with less practical examples and exercises.
I have provided some blog posts of mine related to the topic of performance
testing but in general they are related to software that I've used which isn't
generally known to a less experienced audience (Celery, Twisted). These blog posts
IMO were hard to put into perspective and didn't serve a good purpose as examples.</p>
<p>The practical part of the lesson was a discussion with the goal of creating a
performance testing strategy for GitHub's infrastructure. It was me who was
doing most of the talking because students have no experience working on such
a large infrastructure like GitHub and didn't know what components might be
there, how they might be organized (load balancers, fail overs, etc)
and what needs to be tested.</p>
<p>There was also a more practical example to create a performance test in Java for
one of the classes found in <code>commons-codec/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/digest</code>.
Again the main difficulty here was working fluently with Eclipse, getting the projects to
build/run and knowing how the software under test was supposed to work and be executed.</p>
<h2>Lesson 12 - How to find 1000 bugs in 30 minutes</h2>
<p>This was a more relaxed lesson with examples of simple types of bugs found on a
large scale. Most examples came from my blog and experiments I've made against
Fedora.</p>
<p>While amusing and fun I don't think all of the students understood me and kept
their attention. Part of that is because Fedora tends to focus on low level
stuff and my examples were not necessarily easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Feedback from the sponsor</h2>
<p>Experian Bulgaria was the exclusive sponsor for this course. At the end of the summer
Rado and I met with them to discuss the results of the training. Here's what they say</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall technical knowledge they consider to be weak. What they need are people
with basic knowledge in the field of object oriented programming, databases, operating
systems and networking. These are skills candidates need in order to work for Experian.
It must be noted that most of them were not taught at this course!</li>
<li>English language proficiency for all students is low on average;</li>
<li>User level experience with Linux was fine but students were missing deeper
knowledge about the operating system. Once again something we didn't teach;</li>
<li>The programming languages favored at Experian are Java and Ruby and students
had poor knowledge of them. They also had weak understanding of OOP principles;</li>
<li>According to Experian students were more ingrained with the development mindset
and were trying their luck in the QA profession instead of genuinely being interested
in the field. While this is generally the case I have to point out that as sponsor
Experian did a poor job at promoting their company and the QA profession
as a whole. What isn't known to the general public is their big in-house
QA community which could have served as a source of inspiration for the students!</li>
<li>Low motivation and lack of fundamental knowledge from university are other
traits interviewers at Experian have identified. They argued for a stronger
acceptance process and a requirement of minimum 2 years of university
education in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the topic of testing knowledge candidates did mostly OK, however
we don't have enough information about this. Also the hiring process at
Experian is more focused on the broader knowledge areas listed above so
substantial improvement in the testing knowledge of candidates doesn't given
them much head start.</p>
<p>While to my knowledge they didn't hire anyone few people
received an offer but declined due to various personal reasons. I view this
as poor performance on our side but Experian thinks otherwise and are willing
to sponsor another round of training.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here is a list of all the things that could be improved</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time to develop the curriculum and have it pass QA review by other
experienced testers (in particular such that also teach students);</li>
<li>Make the application process harder to include people with broader IT knowledge;</li>
<li>Allow time to review all applicants;</li>
<li>Find a co-trainer and additional mentors for some of the exercises;</li>
<li>Minimize the number of students accepted in the course so we can handle everyone
with more care;</li>
<li>Give homework assignments and examine them before each lesson;</li>
<li>Collect and provide performance review at the end of the course;</li>
<li>Minimize the technology stack and tools used;</li>
<li>Host a technology preparation session at the beginning paired
with a check list of all the things that need to be done. Very likely
make the chosen technology stack a hard requirement to avoid setbacks
later in the schedule;</li>
<li>We need more fundamental lessons like practical git tutorial,
practical Linux tutorial, databases, networking, etc.</li>
<li>Same goes for Java or any other programming language. Each of these technologies
easily makes a course by itself. Possibly include technology skill assessment
in the application form and reject candidates who don't meet the minimum level.
This is to ensure the group is able to move at the same pace.</li>
<li>We need to improve the infrastructure used during the course,
especially exercise bug tracking and test case management systems;</li>
<li>Students need clear instructions for every exercise - what is required from them,
what the expected result is and what they need to be doing, etc;</li>
<li>Provide more examples for just about everything. Also make the examples
easier to understand/simple with the harder examples left for further
reading;</li>
<li>Provide easier projects to work on. This means applications whose domain
is easier to understand and closer to what experiences the students might have.
Also projects need clear instructions how to join and how to contribute with tests.</li>
<li>The same application/software needs to be used for manual bug finding,
unit test writing and integration test with Selenium. This will minimize
both context and technology switches and allow to view various testing
activities in the context of a single software under test;</li>
<li>While using open source projects for the above listed purposes sounds great
the reality is that they are hard to join and will not move according to our
schedule. Maybe less focus on open source per-se and more focus on a particular
application under test. Instructors can then proxy all the tests forward
to the upstream community;</li>
<li>Focus more on practice and less on exotic topics like performance testing
and large scale bug finding;</li>
<li>Seek more active participation from sponsors!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions please comment below, especially if you can tell me
how to implement them in practice.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                <div class="highlight"><pre>Every activity in software development has a cost and a value. Getting cost to
trend down while increasing value, is the ultimate goal.
</pre></div>


<p>This is the introduction of an e-book called
<a href="http://pi.qasymphony.com/four-quick-wins-thank-you">4 Quick Wins to Manage the Cost of Software Testing</a>.
It was sent to me by Ivan Fingarov couple of months ago. Just now I've managed to
read it and here's a quick summary. I urge everyone to download the original copy
and give it a read.</p>
<p>The paper focuses on several practices which organizations can apply immediately
in order to become more efficient and transparent in their software testing. While
larger organizations (e.g. enterprises) have most of these practices already in place
smaller companies (up to 50-100 engineering staff) may not be familiar with them
and will reap the most benefits of implementing said practices. Even though I work
for a large enterprise I find this guide useful when considered at the individual
team level!</p>
<p>The first chapter focuses on <em>Tactics</em> to minimize cost: Process, Tools, Bug System Mining
and Eliminating Handoffs.</p>
<p>In <em>Process</em> the goal is to minimize the burden of documenting the test process
(aka testing artifacts), allow for better transparency and visibility outside the QA group
and streamline the decision making process of what to test and when to stop testing,
how much has been tested, what the risk is, ect. The authors propose testing core functionality
paired with emerging risk areas based on new features development. They propose making
a list of these and sorting that list by perceived risk/priority and testing as much
as possible. Indeed this is very similar to the method I've used at Red Hat when designing
testing for new features and new major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. A similar
method I've seen in place at several start-ups as well, although in the small organization
the primary driver for this method is lack of sufficient test resources.</p>
<p><em>Tools</em> proposes the use of test case management systems to ease the documentation burden.
I've used <a href="http://testlink.org/">TestLink</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate">Nitrate</a>.
From them Nitrate has more features but is currently unmaintained with me being the
largest contributor on GitHub. From the paid variants I've used
<a href="https://www.polarion.com/products/qa/test-automation">Polarion</a> which I generally dislike.
Polarion is most suitable for large organizations because it gives lots of opportunities
for tracking and reporting. For small organizations it is an overkill.</p>
<p><em>Bug System Mining</em> is a technique which involves regularly scanning the bug tracker
and searching for patterns. This is useful for finding bug types which appear
frequently and generally point to a flaw in the software development process. The fix for these
flaws usually is a change in policy/workflow which eliminates the source of the errors.
I'm a fan of this technique when joining an existing project and need to assess
what the current state is. I've done this when consulting for a few start-ups, including
<a href="http://meet.jit.si">Jitsi Meet</a> (acquired by Atlassian), however I'm not doing bug mining
on a regular basis which I consider a drawback and I really should start doing!</p>
<p>For example at one project I found lots of bugs reported against translations, e.g.
missing translations, text overflowing the visible screen area or not playing well with
existing design, chosen language/style not fitting well with the product domain, etc.</p>
<p>The root cause of the problem was how the software in question has been localized.
The translators were given a file of English strings, which they would translate and
return back in an spread sheet. Developers would copy&amp;paste the translated strings
into localization files and integrate with the software. Then QA would usually
inspect all the pages and report the above issues. The solution was to remove devel
and QA from the translation process, implement a translation management system together
with live preview (web based) so that translators can keep track of what is left to
translate and can visually inspect their work immediately after a string was translated.
Thus translators are given more context for their work but also given the responsibility
to produce good quality translations.</p>
<p>Another example I've seen are many bugs which seem like a follow up/nice to have features
of partially implemented functionality. The root cause of this problem turned out to be
that devel was jumping straight to implementation without taking the time to brainstorm
and consult with QE and product owners, not taking into account corner cases and minor
issues which would have easily been raised by skillful testers. This process lead to
several iterations until the said functionality was considered initially implemented.</p>
<p><em>Eliminating Handoffs</em> proposes the use of cross-functional teams to reduce idle time
and reduce the back-and-forth communication which happens when a bug is found, reported,
evaluated and considered for a fix, fixed by devel and finally deployed for testing.
This method argues that including testers early in the process and pairing them with
the devel team will produce faster bug fixes and reduce communication burden.</p>
<p>While I generally agree with that statement it's worth noting that cross-functional
teams perform really well when all team members have relatively equal skill level
on the horizontal scale and strong experience on the vertical scale (think T-shaped specialist).
Cross-functional teams
don't work well when you have developers who aren't well versed in the testing domain
and/or testers who are not well versed in programming or the broader OS/computer science
fundamentals domain. In my opinion you need well experienced engineers for a good cross-functional
team.</p>
<p>In the chapter <em>Collaboration</em> the paper focuses on pairing, building the right thing
and faster feedback loops for developers. This overlaps with earlier proposals for
cross-functional teams and QA bringing value by asking the "what if" questions.
The chapter specifically talks about the Three Amigos meeting between PM, devel and QA
where they discuss a feature proposal from all angles and finally come to a conclusion
what the feature should look like. I'm a strong supporter of this technique and have
been working with it under one form or another during my entire career. This also
touches on the notion that testers need to move into the <em>Quality Assistance</em> business
and be proactive during the software development process, which is something I'm
hoping to talk about at the
<a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro/">Romanian Testing Conference</a> next year!</p>
<p>Finally the book talks about <em>Skills Development</em> and makes the distinction between
Centers of Excellence (CoE) and Communities of Practice (CoP). Both the book and I
are supporters of the CoP approach. This is a bottoms-up approach which is open for
everyone to join in and harnesses the team creative abilities. It also takes into
account that different teams use different methods and tools and that
"one size doesn't fit all"!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Skilled teams find important bugs faster, discover innovative solutions to hard
testing problems and know how to communicate their value. Sometimes, a few super
testers can replace an army of average testers.
</pre></div>


<p>While I consider myself to be a "super tester" with thousands of bugs reported there
is a very important note to make here. Communities of Practice are successful when
their members are self-focused on skill development! In my view and to some
extent the communities I've worked with everyone should strive to constantly improve
their skills but also exercise peer pressure on their co-workers to not fall behind.
This has been confirmed by other folks in the QA industry and I've heard it many times
when talking to friends from other companies.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    Mutation Testing vs. Coverage
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>At GTAC 2015 Laura Inozemtseva made a lightning talk titled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=47">Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness</a>
which is the single event that got me hooked up with mutation testing.
This year, at GTAC 2016, Rahul Gopinath made a counter argument
with his lightning talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEptA3KP08&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;index=1">Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test Suite Effectiveness</a>.
So which one is better ? I urge you to watch both talks and take notes before
reading about my practical experiment and other opinions on the topic!</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic-Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python
so my view is biased!</p>
<p>Both Laura and Rahul (you will too) agree that a test suite effectiveness depends
on the strength of its oracles. In other words the assertions you make in your tests.
This is what makes a test suite good and determines its ability to detect bugs when
present. I've decided to use <a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab">pelican-ab</a> as
a practical example. pelican-ab is a plugin for Pelican, the static site generator
for Python. It allows you to generate A/B experiments by writing out the content
into different directories and adjusting URL paths based on the experiment name.</p>
<h2>Can 100% code coverage detect bugs</h2>
<p>Absolutely <strong>NOT</strong>! In version 0.2.1,
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ef1e2117ad8ffa5b9fa8470d32d54a36ccb140bb">commit ef1e211</a>,

<p>This is because before each invocation Pelican deletes the output directory and
re-creates the entire content structure. The bug was not caught regardless of
having 100% line + branch coverage. See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/129514715">Build #10</a> for more
info.</p>
<h2>Can 100% mutation coverage detect bugs</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commits/mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment">mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment branch</a>
(requires Pelican==3.6.3).</p>
<p>After initial execution of Cosmic Ray I have 2 mutants left:</p>

<p>The last one, job 33 is equivalent mutation. The first one, job 29 is killed by the test
added in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/b8bff85eeca6c18fbf62cac55fd1a0d64295c43c">commit b8bff85</a>.
For all practical purposes we now have 100% code coverage and 100% mutation coverage.
The bug described above still exists thought.</p>
<h2>How can we detect the bug</h2>
<p>The bug isn't detected by any test because
we don't have tests designed to perform and validate the exact same steps that a
physical person will execute when using pelican-ab. Such test is added in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ca85bd042d783f2f6551ae17f16b29aa3750711b">commit ca85bd0</a>
and you can see that it causes
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/186510356">Build #22</a> to fail.</p>
<p>Experiment with setting <code>DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=False</code> in <code>tests/pelicanconf.py</code> and
the test will PASS!</p>
<h2>Is pelican-ab bug free</h2>
<p>Not of course. Even after 100% code and mutation coverage and after manually constructing
a test which mimics user behavior there is at least one more bug present. There
is a pylint <code>bad-super-call</code> error, fixed in
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/193e3db9e7d021e11b54f54ac8b8718651c633c8">commit 193e3db</a>.
For more information about the error see
<a href="http://mrsenko.com/blog/atodorov/2016/09/14/beware-of-recursion-loop-when-using-super/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Other bugs found</h2>
<p>During my humble experience with mutation testing so far I've added
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pulls/atodorov">quite a few new tests</a>
and discovered two bugs which went unnoticed for years. The first one is
constructor parameter not passed to parent constructor,
see
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-f4294048719aeac4da7a86eee0fbdfd3">PR#96, pykickstart/commands/authconfig.py</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>     def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):
<span class="gd">-        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</span>
<span class="gi">+        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)</span>
         self.authconfig = kwargs.get(&quot;authconfig&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>The second bug is parameter being passed to parent class constructor,
but the parent class doesn't care about this parameter. For example
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-7d2833450b6e1c9a94eb90e7f171ff52">PR#96, pykickstart/commands/driverdisk.py</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gd">-    def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):</span>
<span class="gd">-        BaseData.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)</span>
<span class="gi">+    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):</span>
<span class="gi">+        BaseData.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Also note that pykickstart has nearly 100% test coverage as a whole
and the affected files were 100% covered as well.</p>
<p>The bugs above don't seem like a big deal and when considered out of context
are relatively minor. However pykickstart's biggest client is anaconda, the Fedora
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program. Anaconda uses pykickstart to
parse and generate text files (called kickstart files) which contain information
for driving the installation in a fully automated manner. This is used by everyone
who installs Linux on a large scale and is pretty important functionality!</p>
<p><code>writePriority</code> controls the order of which individual commands are written to file
at the end of the installation. In rare cases the order of commands may depend
on each other. Now imagine the bugs above produce a disordered kickstart file,
which a system administrator thinks should work but it doesn't. It may be the case
this administrator is trying to provision hundreds of Linux systems to bootstrap
a new data center or maybe performing disaster recovery. You get the scale of
the problem now, don't you?</p>
<p>To be honest I've seen bugs of this nature but not in the last several years.</p>
<p>This is all to say a minor change like this may have
an unexpectedly big impact somewhere down the line.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With respect to the above findings and my bias I'll say the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither 100% coverage, nor 100% mutation coverage are a silver bullet against bugs;</li>
<li>100% mutation coverage appears to be better than 100% code coverage in practice;</li>
<li>Mutation testing clearly shows out pieces of code which need refactoring
  which in turn minimizes the number of possible mutations;</li>
<li>Mutation testing causes you to write more asserts and construct more detailed tests
  which is always a good thing when testing software;</li>
<li>You can't replace humans designing test cases just yet but can give them tools
  to allow them to write more and better tests;</li>
<li>You should not rely on a single tool (or two of them) because tools are only
  able to find bugs they were designed for!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus: What others think</h2>
<p>As a bonus to this article let me share a transcript from the
<a href="https://mutation-testing.slack.com">mutation-testing.slack.com</a> community:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>atodorov 2:28 PM
Hello everyone, I&#39;d like to kick-off a discussion / interested in what you think about
Rahul Gopinath&#39;s talk at GTAC this year. What he argues is that test coverage is still
the best metric for how good a test suite is and that mutation coverage doesn&#39;t add much
additional value. His talk is basically the opposite of what @lminozem presented last year
at GTAC. Obviously the community here and especially tools authors will have an opinion on
these two presentations.

tjchambers 12:37 AM
@atodorov I have had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of working on a couple projects lately that illustrate
why LOC test coverage is a misnomer. I am a **strong** proponent of mutation testing so will
declare my bias.

The projects I have worked on have had a mix of test coverage - one about 50% and
another &gt; 90%.

In both cases however there was a significant difference IMO relative to mutation coverage
(which I have more faith in as representative of true tested code).

Critical factors I see when I look at the difference:

- Line length: in both projects the line lengths FAR exceeded visible line lengths that are
&quot;acceptable&quot;. Many LONGER lines had inline conditionals at the end, or had ternary operators
and therefore were in fact only 50% or not at all covered, but were &quot;traversed&quot;

- Code Conviction (my term): Most of the code in these projects (Rails applications) had
significant Hash references all of which were declared in &quot;traditional&quot; format hhh[:symbol].
So it was nearly impossible for the code in execution to confirm the expectation of the
existence of a hash entry as would be the case with stronger code such as &quot;hhh.fetch(:symbol)&quot;

- Instance variables abound: As with most of Rails code the number of instance variables
in a controller are extreme. This pattern of reference leaked into all other code as well,
making it nearly impossible with the complex code flow to ascertain proper reference
patterns that ensured the use of the instance variables, so there were numerous cases
of instance variable typos that went unnoticed for years. (edited)

- .save and .update: yes again a Rails issue, but use of these &quot;weak&quot; operations showed again
that although they were traversed, in many cases those method references could be removed
during mutation and the tests would still pass - a clear indication that save or update was
silently failing.

I could go on and on, but the mere traversal of a line of code in Ruby is far from an indication
of anything more than it may be &quot;typed in correctly&quot;.

@atodorov Hope that helps.

LOC test coverage is a place to begin - NOT a place to end.

atodorov 1:01 AM
@tjchambers: thanks for your answer. It&#39;s too late for me here to read it carefully but
I&#39;ll do it tomorrow and ping you back

dkubb 1:13 AM
As a practice mutation testing is less widely used. The tooling is still maturing. Depending on your
language and environment you might have widely different experiences with mutation testing

I have not watched the video, but it is conceivable that someone could try out mutation testing tools
for their language and conclude it doesn’t add very much

mbj 1:14 AM
Yeah, I recall talking with @lminozem here and we identified that the tools she used likely
show high rates of false positives / false coverage (as the tools likely do not protect against
certain types of integration errors)

dkubb 1:15 AM
IME, having done TDD for about 15+ years or so, and mutation testing for about 6 years, I think
when it is done well it can be far superior to using line coverage as a measurement of test quality

mbj 1:16 AM
Any talk pro/against mutation testing must, as the tool basis is not very homogeneous, show a non consistent result.

dkubb 1:16 AM
Like @tjchambers says though, if you have really poor line coverage you’re not going to
get as much of a benefit from mutation testing, since it’s going to be telling you what
you already know — that your project is poorly tested and lots of code is never exercised

mbj 1:19 AM
Thats a good and likely the core point. I consider that mutation testing only makes sense
when aiming for 100% (and this is to my experience not impractical).

tjchambers 1:20 AM
I don&#39;t discount the fact that tool quality in any endeavor can bring pro/con judgements
based on particular outcomes

dkubb 1:20 AM
What is really interesting for people is to get to 100% line coverage, and then try mutation
testing. You think you’ve done a good job, but I guarantee mutation testing will find dozens
if not hundreds of untested cases .. even in something with 100% line coverage

To properly evaluate mutation testing, I think this process is required, because you can’t
truly understand how little line coverage gives you in comparison

tjchambers 1:22 AM
But I don&#39;t need a tool to tell me that a 250 character line of conditional code that by
itself would be an oversized method AND counts more because there are fewer lines in the
overall percentage contributes to a very foggy sense of coverage.

dkubb 1:22 AM
It would not be unusual for something with 100% line coverage to undergo mutation testing
and actually find out that the tests only kill 60-70% of possible mutations

tjchambers 1:22 AM
@dkubb or less

dkubb 1:23 AM
usually much less :stuck_out_tongue:

it can be really humbling

mbj 1:23 AM
In this discussion you miss that many test suites (unless you have noop detection):
Will show false coverage.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
When I started with mutant on my own project which I developed I had 95% LOC coverage

mbj 1:23 AM
Test suites need to be fixed to comply to mutation testing invariants.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
I had 34% mutation coverage

And that was ignoring the 5% that wasn&#39;t covered at all

mbj 1:24 AM
Also if the tool you compare MT with line coverage on: Is not very strong,
the improvement may not be visible.

dkubb 1:24 AM
another nice benefit is that you will become much better at enumerating all
the things you need to do when writing tests

tjchambers 1:24 AM
@dkubb or better yet - when writing code.

The way I look at it - the fewer the alive mutations the better the test,
the fewer the mutations the better the code.

dkubb 1:29 AM
yeah, you can infer a kind of cyclomatic complexity by looking at how many mutations there are

tjchambers 1:31 AM
Even without tests (not recommended) you can judge a lot from the mutations themselves.

I still am an advocate for mutations/LOC metric
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see members in the community are strong supporters of mutation testing, all of them
having much more experience than I do.</p>
<p>Please help me collect more practical examples! My goal is to
collect enough information and present the findings at
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/">GTAC 2017</a>
which will be held in London.</p>

<p>In Travis-CI when you combine the three main configuration options of
<em>Runtime (language)</em>, <em>Environment</em> and <em>Exclusions/Inclusions</em> you get a
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Build-Matrix">build matrix</a>
of all possible combinations! For example, for <em>django-chartit</em> the matrix includes
43 build jobs, spread across various Python and Django versions. For reference
see <a href="https://travis-ci.org/chartit/django-chartit/builds/181115880">Build #75</a>.</p>
<p>For <em>django-chartit</em> I wanted to have an additional build job which would execute
pylint. I wanted the job to be independent because currently pylint produces lots
of errors and warnings. Having an independent job instead of integrating pylint
together with all jobs makes it easier to see if any of the functional tests failed.</p>
<p>Using the inclusion functionality of Travis-CI I was able to define an auxiliary
build job. The trick is to provide sane environment defaults for all
build jobs (regular and auxiliary ones) so you don't have to expand your environment
section! In this case the change looks like this</p>

<p>Googling for <code>vm_call_cfunc - cfp consistency error</code> yields
<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10460">Ruby #10460</a>. Comments on the bug and
particularly this one point towards the error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; Ruby is trying to be nice about reporting the error; but in the end,
&gt; your code is still broken if it overflows stack.
</pre></div>


<p>Somewhere in the test suite was a piece of code that was overflowing the stack.
It was somewhere along the lines of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;#active_client_for_user&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">context</span> <span class="s1">&#39;matching an existing user&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Considering the examples in the bug I started looking for patterns where a variable
was defined and later redefined, possibly circling back to the previous definition.
Expanding the shared examples by hand transformed the code into</p>

<p>Line 5. overrode line 3. When line 4. was executed first because of lazy execution
and the call execution path became: 4-5-4-5-4-5 ... <strong>NOTE:</strong> I think we need a
warning about that in RuboCop, see

                    Highlights from ISTA and GTAC 2016
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="ISTA 2016" src="/images/ista2016.jpg" title="ISTA 2016" /></p>
<p>Another two weeks have passed and I'm blogging about another 2 conferences.
This year both
<a href="https://istacon.org/">Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2016/">Google Test Automation Conference</a>
happened on the same day. I was attending ISTA in Sofia during the day and
watching the live stream of GTAC during the evenings. Here are some of the things
that reflected on me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I build my software in order to make this a perfect day for the user ?</li>
<li>People are not the problem which causes bad software to exist. When designing
software focus on what people need not on what technology is forcing them to do;</li>
<li>You need to have blind trust in the people you work with because all the times
projects look like they are not going to work until the very end!</li>
<li>It's good to have diverse set of characters in the company and not homogenize people;</li>
<li>Team performance grows over time. Effective teams minimize time waste
during bad periods. They (have and) extract value from conflicts!</li>
<li>One-on-one meetings are usually like status reports which is bad. Both parties
should bring their own issues to the table;</li>
<li>To grow an effective team members need to do things together. For example
pair programming, writing test scenarios, etc;</li>
<li>When teams don't take actions after retrospective meetings it is usually a 
sign of missing foundational trust;</li>
<li>QA engineers need to be present at every step of the software development
life-cycle! This is something I teach my students and have been confirmed by
many friends in the industry;</li>
<li>Agile is all about data, even when it comes to testing and quality. We need to
decompose and measure iteratively;</li>
<li>Agile is also about really skillful people. One way to boost your skills is to
adopt the T-shaped specialist model;</li>
<li>In agile iterative work and continuous delivery is king so QA engineers need to focus
even more on visualization (I will also add documentation), refactoring and code reviews;</li>
<li>Agile teams need to give opportunities to team members for taking risk and taking
ownership of their actions in the gray zone (e.g. actions which isn't clear who should
be doing).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the brave new world of micro services end to end testing is no more! We test each level
in isolation but keep stable contracts/APIs between levels. That way we can reduce
the test burden and still guarantee an acceptable level of risk. This change in
software architecture (monolithic vs. micro) leads to change in technologies (one framework/language
vs. what's best for the task) which in turn leads to changes in testing approach and
testing tools. This ultimately leads to changing people on the team because they now
need different skills than when they were hired! This circles back to the T-shaped
specialist model and the fact that QA should be integrated in every step of the way!
Thanks to Denitsa Evtimova and Lyudmila Labova for this wisdom and the quote pictured
above.</p>
<p>Aneta Petkova talked about monitoring of test results which is a topic very close to my work.
Imagine you have your automated test suite but still get failures occasionally. Are these
bugs or something else broke ? If they are bugs and you are waiting for them to be fixed
do you execute the tests against the still broken build or wait ? If you do, what additional info
do you get from these executions vs. how much time do you spend figuring out
"oh, that's still not fixed or geez, here's another hidden bug in the code" ?</p>
<p>Her team has modified their test execution framework (what I'd usually call a test runner
or even test lab) to have knowledge about issues in JIRA and skip some tests
when no meaningful information can be extracted from them. I have to point out that this
approach may require a lot of maintenance in environments where you have failures due to
infrastructure issues. This idea connects very nicely
with the general idea behind this year's GTAC - don't run tests if you don't need to aka
smart test execution!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=2h54m0s">Boris Prikhodskiy</a>
shared a very simple rule. Don't execute tests</p>
<ul>
<li>which have 100 % pass rate;</li>
<li>during the last month;</li>
<li>and have been executed at least 100 times before that!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Unity does for their numerous topic branches and reduces test time
with 60-70 percent. All of the test suite is still executed against their trunk branch
and PR merge queue branches!</p>
<p>At GTAC there were several presentations about speeding up test execution time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=3h18m25s">Emanuil Slavov</a> was very practical
but the most important thing he said was that a fast test suite is the result of many
conscious actions which introduced small improvements over time. His team had assigned
themselves the task to iteratively improve their test suite performance and at every step
of the way they analyzed the existing bottlenecks and experimented with possible solutions.</p>
<p>The steps in particular are (on a single machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute tests in dedicated environment;</li>
<li>Start with empty database, not used by anything else; This also leads to
adjustments in your test suite architecture and DB setup procedures;</li>
<li>Simulate and stub external dependencies like 3rd party services;</li>
<li>Move to containers but beware of slow disk I/O;</li>
<li>Run database in memory not on disk because it is a temporary DB anyway;</li>
<li>Don't clean test data, just trash the entire DB once you're done;</li>
<li>Execute tests in parallel which should be the last thing to do!</li>
<li>Equalize workload between parallel threads for optimal performance;</li>
<li>Upgrade the hardware (RAM, CPU) aka vertical scaling;</li>
<li>Add horizontal scaling (probably with a messaging layer);</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=6h38m7s">John Micco and Atif Memon</a>
talked about flaky tests at Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of the transitions from PASS to FAIL are flakes;</li>
<li>Almost 16% of their 3.5 million tests have some level of flakiness;</li>
<li>Flaky failures frequently block and delay releases;</li>
<li>Google spends between 2% and 16% of their CI compute resources
re-running flaky tests;</li>
<li>Flakiness insertion speed is comparable to flakiness removal speed!</li>
<li>The optimal setting is 2 persons modifying the same source file at the same time.
This leads to minimal chance of breaking stuff;</li>
<li>Fix or delete flaky tests because you don't get meaningful value out of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Google want to stop a test execution before it is executed if historical
data shows that the test has attributes of flakiness. The research they talk
about utilizes tons of data collected from Google's CI environment which was
the most interesting fact for me. Indeed if we use data to decide which features
to build for our customers then why not use data to govern the process of testing?
In addition to the video you should read John's post
<a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/05/flaky-tests-at-google-and-how-we.html">Flaky Tests at Google and How We Mitigate Them</a>.</p>
<p>At the end I'd like to finish with 
Rahul Gopinath's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=4h57m30s">Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test suite Effectiveness in the Real World</a>.
He basically said that code coverage metrics as we know them today are still
the best practical indicator of how good a test suite is. He argues that mutation testing is slow
and only provides additional 4% to a well designed test suite. This is absolutely the opposite of
what Laura Inozemtseva presented last year in her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;list=PLSIUOFhnxEiCWGsN9t5A-XOhRbmz54IS1&amp;index=25">Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness</a>
lightning talk. Rahul also made a point about sample size in the two research papers
and I had the impression he's saying Laura didn't do a proper academic research.</p>
<p>I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python and also use
mutation testing in my daily job so this is a very interesting topic indeed. I've asked
fellow tool authors to have a look at both presentations and share their opinions.
I also have an idea about a practical experiment to see if full branch coverage and
full mutation coverage will be able to find a known bug in a piece of software
I wrote. I will be writing about this experiment next week so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    Women In Open Source
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="OpenFest 2016" src="/images/openfest2016.jpg" title="OpenFest 2016" /></p>
<p>It's been 2 weeks after <a href="http://openfest.org">OpenFest 2016</a> and I've promised
to blog about what happened during the <em>Women in Open Source</em> presentation, which
is the only single talk I did attend.</p>
<p>The presenters were Jona Azizaj, whom I met at FOSDEM
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">earlier this year</a>,
Suela Palushi and Kristi Progri, all 3 from Albania. I've went to OpenFest
specifically to meet them and listen to their presentation.</p>
<p>They started by explaining
their background and telling us more about their respective communities,
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Women">Fedora Women</a>,
<a href="http://womoz.org">WoMoz</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/">GNOME Outreach</a> and the 
<a href="https://openlabs.cc/">Open Labs</a> hackerspace in Tirana.
The girls gave some stats how many women there are in the larger FOSS
community and what some newcomer's first impressions could be.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know that in 2002 1.1% of all FOSS participants were female, while in
2013 that was 11% ? A 10x increase but of them only 1.5% are developers.</strong></p>
<p>The presentation was a nice overview of different opportunities
to get involved in open source geared towards women. I've specifically asked and
the girls responded how they first came to join open source. In general they've
had a good and welcoming community around them which made it natural to
join and thrive.</p>
<p>Now comes the sad part. Instead of welcoming and supporting these girls that they've
stood up to talk about their experiences the audience did the opposite. In particular
<a href="http://plushiegames.com/">Maya Milusheva from Plushie Games</a> made a very passionate claim
against the topic women in tech. It went like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a woman</li>
<li>I am a good developer</li>
<li>I am a mother</li>
<li>I am a CEO of a successful IT company</li>
<li>when I hire I want the best people for my company and they are men</li>
<li>women simply don't have the required tech skills/level of expertise</li>
<li>the whole talk about women in open source/diversity is bullshit</li>
<li>girls need to sit down on their asses and read more, code more, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of successfullness I think I can compare to Maya. I also have a small
child, which I regularly take to conferences with me (the badges above).
I also have an IT company
which generates a comparable amount of income. I also want to hire the best employees
for any given project I'm working on. Sometimes it's happened that to be a woman,
sometimes not. The point here however was not about hiring more women per se. It
was about giving opportunities in the communities and letting people grow for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>
Yes, she has a point but there's something WRONG in coming to listen to a presenter
just to tell them they are full of shit! It's
very arrogant shouting around and arguing a point about hiring when in fact the
entire presentation was not about hiring!
It is totally unacceptable,
The NY Times writing about apps you develop and behaving like an asshole at public events at
the same time!
</strong></p>
<p>I've been there, the crowd telling me I'm full of shit when I've been presenting about
new technologies. I've been there being told that my ideas will not work in this or that
way, while in fact the very idea of trying and considering a completely different
technological approach was what counted. And finally I've been there years later when
the same ideas and technologies have become mainstream and the same crowd was now talking
about them!</p>
<p>After Maya there was another person who grabbed the microphone and continued to talk nonsense.
Unfortunately he didn't state his name and I don't know the guy in person. What he said was
along the lines of <em>little boys play with robots, little girls play with dolls. They like it
this way and that's why girls don't get involved in the technical field. Also if a girl
played with robots she will be called a tomboy and generally have a negative attitude
towards her</em>.</p>
<p>It's absolutely clear this guy has no idea what he's talking about.
Everyone who has small children around them
will agree that they are born with equal mental capacity. It is up to the
environment, parents, teachers, etc to shape this capacity in a positive way. I've
seen children who taught themselves speaking English from YouTube and children the
same age barely speaking Bulgarian. I've seen children who are curious about the world
and how it works and children who can't wipe their own noses. It's not because they
like it that way, it's because of their parents and the environment they live in.</p>
<p>Finally I'd like to respond to this guy (I was specifically motioned at the conference
not to respond) with this</p>
<p><strong>
I have a 5 year old girl. She likes robots as much as she likes dolls. She works with Linux
and is lucky enough to have one of the two OLPCs laptops in Bulgaria. She plays
SuperTux and has already found a bug in it (I've reported it). She's been to several
Linux and IT conferences as you can see from the picture above.
She likes being taken to hackathons and learning about inspiring stuff that students are doing.</p>
<p>Are you telling me that because we have the wrong idea women can't be good at technology
she can't become a successful engineer ? Are you telling me to basically scratch the next 10 years
of her life and tell her she can't become what she wants ? Because if you do I say FUCK OFF!</p>
<p>Even I as a parent don't have the power to tell my child what they can do or not do,
what they can accomplish or not. My job is to show them the various possibilities that
exist and guide and support them along they way they want to go! This is what we as society
also need to do for everyone else!
</strong></p>
<p>To wrap up I will tell you about a psychological experiment we devised with Jona and Suela.
I've proposed
to find a male and female student in Tirana and have them pose online as somebody from the opposite
sex, fake accounts and all. They've proposed having the same person both act as male or female
for the purposes of evening out the tech skills difference.
The goal is to see how does the tech community react to their contributions and try to measure
how much does their gender being known affect their performance! I hope the girls will
find a way to perform this experiment together with the university Psychology department
and share the results with us.</p>
<p>Btw I will be visiting
<a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/">OSCAL'17</a> to check up on that so see you in Albania!</p>

                <p>Today I have re-build the wifi and backlight drivers for MacBook Air
against the upcoming Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 kernel.
<em>wl-kmod</em> again needed a
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/wl-kmod-for-rhel7/commit/c6b3d0fde66dd29671df5f52c40f7395f1e1e59e">small patch</a>
before it can be compiled. <em>mba6x_bl</em> has been updated to the latest
upstream and compiled without errors. The current RPM versions are</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>akmod-wl-6.30.223.248-9.el7.x86_64.rpm

</pre></div>


<p>and they seem to work fine for me. Let me know if you have any issues
after RHEL 7.3 comes out officially.</p>
<p>PS: The <a href="https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie">bcwc_pcie</a> driver for the video camera
appears to be ready for general use, regardless of some issues. No promises here
but I'll try to compile that one as well and provide it in my
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/04/29/rhel-7-repository-for-macbook-air/">Macbook Air RHEL 7 repository</a>.</p>
<p>PS2: Sometime after Sept 14th I have probably upgraded my system and now it can't
detect external displays if the display is not plugged in during boot. I'm seeing
the following</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># cat /sys/class/drm/card0-DP-1/enabled
disabled

<p>which appears to be the same issue reported on the
<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1269591#p1269591">ArchLinux forum</a>.
I'm in a hurry to resolve this and any help is welcome.</p>

                <p>For some time now I've been hitting
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12506">PhantomJS #12506</a> with the
latest 2.1.1 version. The problem is supposedly fixed in 2.1.0 but this is not
always the case. If you use a .deb package from the latest Ubuntu then the problem
still exists, see

<p>While building from the upstream sources gives</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>ldd /tmp/bin/phantomjs <span class="p">|</span> grep -i qt
</pre></div>


<p>If you take a closer look at PhantomJS's sources you will notice there are
3 git submodules in their repository - <code>3rdparty</code>, <code>qtbase</code> and <code>qtwebkit</code>.
Then in their <code>build.py</code> you can clearly see that this local fork of <code>QtWebKit</code>
is built first, then the <code>phantomjs</code> binary is built against it.</p>
<p>The problem is that these custom forks include additional patches to make
WebKit suitable for Phantom's needs. And these patches are not available
in the stock WebKit library that Ubuntu uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's correct. We need additional functionality that
vanilla QtWebKit doesn't have. That's why we use custom version.</p>
<p>Vitaly Slobodin, PhantomJS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment of this writing Vitaly's qtwebkit fork is 28 commits ahead and
39 commits behind qt:dev. I'm surprised Ubuntu's PhantomJS even works.</p>
<p>The solution IMO is to bundle the additional sources into the src.deb package
and use the same building procedure as upstream.</p>

                    Testing the 8-bit computer Puldin
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p><img alt="Puldin creators" src="/images/puldin_creators.jpg" title="Puldin creators" /></p>
<p>Last weekend I visited <a href="http://tuxcon.mobi">TuxCon</a> in Plovdiv and
was very happy to meet and talk to some of the creators of the Puldin
computer! On the picture above are (left to right) Dimitar Georgiev
- wrote the text editor, Ivo Nenov - BIOS, DOS and core OS developer,
Nedyalko Todorov - director of the vendor company and Orlin Shopov -
BIOS, DOS, compiler and core OS developer.</p>
<p>Puldin is 100% pure Bulgarian development, while the “Pravetz” brand
was copy of Apple ][ (Pravetz 8A, 8C, 8M), Oric (Pravets 8D) and IBM-PC
(Pravetz 16). The Puldin computers were build from scratch both hardware
and software and were produced in Plovdiv in the late 80s and early 90s.
50000 pieces were made, at least 35000 of them have been exported to Russia
and paid for. A typical configuration in a Russian class room consisted of
several Puldin computers and a single Pravetz 16. According to Russian sources
the last usage of these computers was in 2003 serving as Linux terminals
and being maintained without any support from the vendor
(b/c it ceased to exist).</p>
<p><img alt="Puldin 601" src="/images/puldin601.jpg" title="Puldin 601" /></p>
<p>One of the main objectives of Puldin was full compatibility with IBM-PC.
At the time IBM had been releasing extensive documentation about how their
software and hardware works which has been used by Puldin's creators as
their software specs. Despite IBM-PC using faster CPU the Puldin 601 had
a comparable performance due to aggressive software and compiler optimizations.</p>
<p>Testing wise the guys used to compare Puldin's functionality with that of IBM-PC.
It was a hard requirement to have full compatibility on the file storage layer,
that means floppy disks written on Puldin had to be readable on IBM-PC and vice
versa. Same goes for programs compiled on Puldin - they had to execute on IBM-PC.</p>
<p>Everything of course had been tested manually and on top of that all the software
had to be burned to ROM before you can do anything with it. As you can imagine the
testing process had been quite slow and painful compared to today's standards.
I've asked the guys if they'd happened to find a bug in IBM-PC which wasn't present
in their code but they couldn't remember.</p>
<p>What was interesting for me on the hardware side was the fact that you can plug
the computer directly to a cheap TV set and that it's been one of the first computers
which could operate on 12V DC, powered directly from a car battery.</p>
<p><img alt="Pravetz 8" src="/images/pravetz16.jpg" title="Pravetz 8" /></p>
<p>There was also a fully functional Pravetz 8 with an additional VGA port to
connect it to the LCD monitor as well as a SD card reader wired to function as a
floppy disk reader (the small black dot behind the joystick).</p>
<p>For those who missed it (and understand Bulgarian) I have a

                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>When designing automated test cases we often think either about increasing
coverage or in terms of testing more use-cases aka behavior scenarios. Both
are valid approaches to improve testing and both of them seem to focus
around execution control flow (or business logic). However program behavior
is sometimes controlled via the contents of its data structures and this is
something which is rarely tested. </p>
<p>In
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/26#discussion_r32790705">this comment</a>
Brian C. Lane and Vratislav Podzimek from Red Hat are talking about a data structure
which maps Fedora versions to particular implementations of kickstart commands.
For example</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RHEL7Handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BaseHandler</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>In their particular case the Fedora 21 <code>logvol</code> implementation introduced the
<code>--profile</code> parameter but in
Fedora 22 and Fedora 23 the <code>logvol</code> command mapped to the Fedora 20 implementation and the
<code>--profile</code> parameter wasn't available. This is unexpected change in program behavior
although the <code>logvol.py</code> and <code>handlers/f22.py</code> files have
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/pykickstart-coverage/blob/master/coverage-report.log">99% and 100% code coverage</a>.</p>
<p>This morning I did some coding and created an automated test for this problem. The test
iterates over all command maps. For each command in the map (that is data structure member)
we load the module which provides all possible implementations for that command. In the
loaded module
we search for implementations which have newer versions than what is in the map,
but not newer than the current Fedora version under test. With a little bit of pruning
the current list of offenses is</p>

<p>The first two are possibly false negatives or related to the naming conventions used
in this module. However the rest appear to be legitimate problems. The <code>user</code> command
has introduced the <code>--groups</code> parameter in Fedora 24 (devel is Fedora 25 currently) but the
parser will fail to recognize this parameter. The <code>logvol</code> problem is recognized as well
since it was never patched. And the Fedora 18 <code>network</code> command implements a new property called
<code>hostname</code> which has probably never been available to be used.</p>

                    Don't Upgrade Galaxy S5 to Android 6.0
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Samsung is shipping out buggy software like a boss, no doubt about it.
I've written a bit about <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/categories/samsung/">their bugs</a> previously.
However I didn't expect them to release Android 6.0.1 and render my
<a href="http://amzn.to/1tiiqze">Galaxy S5</a> completely useless with respect
to the feature I use the most.</p>
<p><img alt="Lockscreen" src="/images/samsung/lockscreen_bug.jpg" title="Lockscreen" /></p>
<h2>Tell me the weather for Brussels</h2>
<p>So on Monday I've let Android upgrade to 6.0.1 to be completely surprised
that the lockscreen shows the weather report for Brussels, while
I'm based in Sofia. I've checked <em>AccuWeather</em> (I did go to
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/">Brussels earlier this year</a>)
but it displayed only Sofia and Thessaloniki. To get rid of this widget
go to <code>Settings -&gt; Lockscreen -&gt; Additional information</code> and turn it off!</p>
<p>I think this weather report comes from GPS/Location based data, which I
have turned off by default but did use a while back ago. After turning
the widget off and back on it didn't appear on the lockscreen. I suspect
they fall back to showing the last good known value when data is missing
instead of handling the error properly.</p>
<h2>Apps are gone</h2>
<p>Some of my installed apps are missing now. So far I've noticed that the
<em>Gallery</em> and <em>S Health</em> icons have disappeared from my homescreen. I think
<em>S Health</em> came from Samsung's app store but still they shouldn't have removed
it silently. Now I wonder what happened to my data.</p>
<p>I don't see why <em>Gallery</em> was removed though. The only way to view pictures
is to use the camera app preview functionality which is kind of grose.</p>
<h2>Grayscale in powersafe mode is gone</h2>
<p>The killer feature on these higher end Galaxy devices is the <em>Powersafe mode</em>
and <em>Ultra Powersafe mode</em>. I use them a lot and by default have my phone in
<em>Powersafe mode</em> with grayscale colors enabled. It is easier on the eyes and
also safes your battery.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> grayscale colors don't affect some displays but these devices use
AMOLED screens which need different amounts of power to display different
colors. More black means less power required!</p>
<p>After the upgrade grayscale is no more. There's not even an on/off switch.
I've managed to find a workaround though. First you need to enable developer mode
by tapping 7 times on <code>About device -&gt; Build number</code>. Then go to
<code>Settings -&gt; Developer options</code>, look for the <code>Hardware Accelerated Rendering</code>
section and select <code>Simulate Color Space -&gt; Monochromacy</code>! This is a bit ugly
hack and doesn't have the convenience of turning colors on/off by tapping
the quick Powersafe mode button at the top of the screen!</p>
<p>It looks like Samsung didn't think this upgrade well enough or didn't test it
well enough ? In my line of work (installation and upgrade testing) I've rarely
seen such a big blunder. Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

them find defect which nobody else will notice.

Most often errors/mistakes in software development are made due to
wrong expectations or wrong assumptions. Very often this happens because
developers hope their software will be used in one particular way
(as it was designed to) or that a particular set of data will be returned.
Thus the skill to think outside the box is the most important skill
we (as employers) are looking to find in a QA candidate. At job interviews
you can expect to be given tasks and questions which examine those skills.

<h2>How would you test a pen?</h2>
<p>This is Ivaylo's favorite question for QA candidates. He's looking for
attention to details and knowing when to stop testing. Some of the possible
answers related to core functionality are</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the pen write in the correct color</li>
<li>Does the color fades over time</li>
<li>Does the pen operate normally at various temperatures? What temperature
  intervals would you choose for testing</li>
<li>Does the pen operate normally at various atmospheric pressure</li>
<li>When writing, does the pen leave excessive ink</li>
<li>When writing, do you get a continuous line or not</li>
<li>What pressure does the user need to apply in order to write a
  continuous line</li>
<li>What surfaces can the pen write on? What surfaces would you test</li>
<li>Are you able to write on a piece of paper if there is something soft underneath</li>
<li>What is the maximum inclination angle at which the pen is able to write
  without problems</li>
<li>Does the ink dry fast</li>
<li>If we spill different liquids onto a sheet of paper, on which we had written
  something, does the ink stay intact or smear</li>
<li>Can you use pencil rubber to erase the ink? What else would you test</li>
<li>How long can you write before we run out of ink</li>
<li>How fat is the ink line</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Ivaylo gives a few more non-obvious answers</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that all labels on the pen/ink cartridge are correctly spelled
  and how durable they are (try to erase them)</li>
<li>Strength test - what is the maximum height you can drop the pen from
  without breaking it</li>
<li>Verify that dimensions are correct</li>
<li>Test if the pen keeps writing after not being used for some time
  (how long)</li>
<li>Testing individual pen components under different temperature and
  atmospheric conditions</li>
<li>Verify that materials used to make the pen are safe, e.g. when you put
  the pen in your mouth</li>
</ul>
<p>When should you stop ? According to the book there can be between 50 and 100
test cases for a single pen, maybe more. It's not a good sign if you stop at
the first 3!</p>

                    DEVit Conf 2016
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>It's been another busy week after <a href="http://devitconf.org/">DEVit conf</a> took place in
Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.</p>
<p><img alt="DEVit 2016" src="/images/devit2016.jpg" title="DEVit 2016" /></p>
<h2>Pre-conference</h2>
<p><a href="http://techministry.gr">TechMinistry</a> is Thessaloniki's hacker space which
is hosted at a central location, near major shopping streets.
I've attended an
<a href="http://discourse.techministry.gr/t/18-05-2016-19-30-open-source-wednesday/67">Open Source Wednesday</a>
meeting. From the event description I thought that
there was going to be a discussion about getting involved with
Firefox. However that was not the case.
Once people started coming in they formed organic groups and
started discussing various topics on their own.</p>
<p>I was also shown their 3D printer which IMO is the most precise of 3D printers
I've seen so far. Imagine what it would be like to click <em>Print</em>, sometime
in the future, and have your online orders appear on your desk over night.
That would be quite cool!</p>
<p>I've met with <a href="https://twitter.com/bacharakis">Christos Bacharakis</a>, a Mozilla
representative for Greece, who gave me some goodies for my students at HackBulgaria!</p>
<p>On Thursday I spent the day merging pull requests for
<a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme">MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme</a>
and attended the DEVit Speakers dinner at
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/massaliathessaloniki/">Massalia</a>.
Food and drinks were very good and I even found a new recipe for mushrooms with
ouzo, of which I think I had a bit too many :).</p>
<p>I was also told that <em>"a full stack developer is a developer who can introduce
a bug to every layer of the software stack"</em>. I can't agree more!</p>
<h2>DEVit</h2>
<p>The conference day started with a huge delay due to long queues for registration.
The fist talk I attended, and the best one IMO was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCGBgI1MNwE&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db">Need It Robust? Make It Fragile!</a>
by Yegor Bugayenko (watch the video). There he talked about two different approaches to writing
software: fail safe vs. fail fast.</p>
<p>He argues that when software is designed to
fail fast bugs are discovered earlier in the development cycle/software lifetime
and thus are easier to fix, making the whole system more robust and more stable.
On the other hand when software is designed to hide failures and tries to
recover auto-magically the same problems remain hidden for longer and when they
are finally discovered they are harder to fix. This is mostly due to the fact that
the original error condition is hidden and manifested in a different way which
makes it harder to debug.</p>
<p>Yegor made several examples, all of which are valid code, which he considers
bad practice. For example imagine we have a function that accepts a filename
as parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">read_file_fail_safe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="c"># read the file, do something else</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bytes_read</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">read_file_fail_fast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;File does not exist&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c"># read the file, do something else</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bytes_read</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the first example <code>read_file_fail_safe</code> returns -1 on error. The trouble is
whoever is calling this method may not check for errors thus corrupting the
flow of the program further down the line. You may also want to collect metrics and
update your database with the number of bytes processed - this will totally
skew your metrics. C programmers out there will quickly remember at least
one case when they didn't check the return code for errors!</p>
<p>The second example <code>read_file_fail_fast</code> will raise an exception the moment
it encounters a problem. It's not its fault that the file doesn't exist and
there's nothing it can do about it, nor is its job to do anything about it.
Raising an exception will surface back to the caller and they will be notified
about the problem, taking appropriate actions to resolve it.</p>
<p>Yegor was also unhappy that many books teach fail safe and even IDEs (for Java)
generate fail safe boiler-plate code (need to check this)!
Indeed it is me who asks the first question
<em>Are there any tools to detect fail safe code patterns?</em> and it turns out there aren't
(for the majority of cases that is). If you happen to know such a tool
please post a link in the comments below.</p>
<p>I was a bit disappointed by the rest of the talks. They were all high-level
overviews IMO and didn't go deep technical. Last year was better. I also
wanted to attend the GitHub Patchwork workshop but looking at the agenda
it looked like this is for users who are starting with git and GitHub
(which I'm not).</p>
<p>The closing session of the day was
<em>"Real time front-end alchemy, or: capturing, playing, altering and encoding
video and audio streams, without servers or plugins!"</em> by Soledad Penades from
Mozilla. There she gave a demo about the latest and greatest in terms of
audio and video capturing, recording and mixing natively in the browser.
This is definitively very cool for apps in the audio/video space but I can
also imagine an application for us software testers.</p>
<p>Depending on computational and memory requirements you should be able to
record everything the user does in their browser (while on your website)
and send it back home when they want to report an error or contact support.
Definitely better than screenshots and having to go back and forth until
the exact steps to reproduce are established.</p>

                    Mismatch in Pyparted Interfaces
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Last week my co-worker Marek Hruscak, from Red Hat, found an interesting case of
mismatch between the two interfaces provided by pyparted. In this article
I'm going to give an example, using simplified code and explain what is
happening. From pyparted's documentation we learn the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pyparted is a set of native Python bindings for libparted.  libparted is the
library portion of the GNU parted project.  With pyparted, you can write
applications that interact with disk partition tables and filesystems.</p>
<p>The Python bindings are implemented in two layers.  Since libparted itself
is written in C without any real implementation of objects, a simple 1:1
mapping of externally accessible libparted functions was written.  This
mapping is provided in the _ped Python module.  You can use that module if
you want to, but it's really just meant for the larger parted module.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">_ped</span>       <span class="nx">libparted</span> <span class="nx">Python</span> <span class="nx">bindings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">direct</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">mapping</span>

</pre></div>


</blockquote>
<p>The two interfaces are the <code>_ped</code> and <code>parted</code> modules. As a user I expect them
to behave exactly the same but they don't. For example some partition properties
are read-only in libparted and <code>_ped</code> but not in <code>parted</code>. This is the mismatch
I'm talking about.</p>

<p>The test in <code>test__ped_partition.py</code> works without problems, I've modified it for
visual reference only. This was also the inspiration behind the test in
<code>test_parted_partition.py</code>. However the second test fails with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>======================================================================
FAIL: runTest (tests.test_parted_partition.PartitionGetSetTestCase)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/tmp/pyparted/tests/test_parted_partition.py&quot;, line 41, in runTest
    self.part.geometry = parted.Geometry(self.device, start=10, length=20)
AssertionError: (&lt;type &#39;exceptions.AttributeError&#39;&gt;, &lt;type &#39;exceptions.TypeError&#39;&gt;) not raised

----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre></div>


<p>Now it's clear that something isn't quite the same between the two interfaces.
If we look at <code>src/parted/partition.py</code> we see the following snippet</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>137     fileSystem = property(lambda s: s._fileSystem, lambda s, v: setattr(s, &quot;_fileSystem&quot;, v))
138     geometry = property(lambda s: s._geometry, lambda s, v: setattr(s, &quot;_geometry&quot;, v))
139     system = property(lambda s: s.__writeOnly(&quot;system&quot;), lambda s, v: s.__partition.set_system(v))
140     type = property(lambda s: s.__partition.type, lambda s, v: setattr(s.__partition, &quot;type&quot;, v))
</pre></div>


<p>The geometry property is indeed read-write but the system property is write-only.
<code>git blame</code> leads us to the interesting
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pyparted/commit/2fc0ee2b">commit 2fc0ee2b</a>, which changes
definitions for quite a few properties and removes the <code>_readOnly</code> method which raises
an exception. Even more interesting is the fact that the <code>Partition.geometry</code> property
hasn't been changed. If you look closer you will notice that the deleted definition and
the new one are exactly the same. Looks like the problem existed even before this change.</p>
<p>Digging down even further we find
<a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pyparted/commit/7599aa1ae505f3784ca4936b58b38b8dffb752ff">commit 7599aa1</a>
which is the very first implementation of the <code>parted</code> module. There you can see the
<code>_readOnly</code> method and some properties like <code>path</code> and <code>disk</code> correctly marked as such
but <code>geometry</code> isn't.</p>
<p>Shortly after this commit the first test was added (4b9de0e) and a bit
later the second, empty test class, was added (c85a5e6). This only goes
to show that every piece of software needs appropriate QA coverage, which
pyparted was kind of lacking (and I'm trying to change that).</p>
<p>The reason this bug went unnoticed for so long
is the limited exposure of pyparted. To my knowledge anaconda, the Fedora installer
is its biggest (if not single) consumer and maybe it uses only the <code>_ped</code>
interface (I didn't check) or it doesn't try to do silly things like setting
a value to a read-only property.</p>
<p><strong>
The lesson from this story is to test all of your interfaces and also
make sure they are behaving in exactly the same manner!

                    How To Hire Software Testers, Pt. 2
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In my
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/12/how-to-hire-software-testers-pt-1/">previous post</a> I have
described the process I follow when interviewing candidates for a QA position.
The first question is designed to expose the applicant's way of thinking.
My second question is designed to examine their technical understanding
and to a lesser extent their way of thinking.</p>
<p><img alt="Sudoku" src="/images/sudoku.png" title="Sudoku" /></p>
<h2>How do You Test a Sudoku Solving Function</h2>
<p>You have implementation of a sudoku solver function with the following pseudocode:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>func Sudoku(Array[2]) {
    ...
    return Array[2]
}
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>The function solves a sudoku puzzle;</li>
<li>Input parameter is a two-dimensional array with the known numbers (from 1 to 9) in the Sudoku grid;</li>
<li>The output is a two-dimensional array with the numbers from the solved puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have 10 minutes to write down a list of all test cases you can think of!</p>
<h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
<p>One set of possible tests is to examine the input and figure out if the
function has been passed valid data.
In the real-world programs interact with each other, they are not alone.
Sometimes it happens that a valid output from one program isn't a
valid input for the next one. Also we have malicious users who will try to
break the program.</p>
<p>If a person manages to test for this case then
I know they have a bit more clue about how software is used in the real-world.
This also touches a bit on white-box testing, where the tester has full info
about the software under test. In this example the implementation is
intentionally left blank.</p>
<p>OTOH I've seen answers where the applicant blindly assumes that the input
is 1-9, because the spec says so, and excludes the entire input testing from
their scope. I classify this answer as immediate failure, because a tester should
never assume anything and test to verify their initial conditions are indeed
as stated in the documentation.</p>
<p>Another set of possible tests is to verify the correct work of the function.
That is to verify the proposed Sudoku solution is indeed following the rules
of the game. This is what we usually refer to black-box testing. The tester
doesn't know how the SUT works internally, they only know the input data and
the expected output. </p>
<p>If a person fails to describe at least one such test case
they have essentially failed the question. What is the point of a SUT which
doesn't crash (suppose that all previous tests passed) but doesn't
produce the desired correct result ?</p>
<p>Then there are test cases related to the environment in which this Sudoku
solver function operates. This is where I examine the creativity of the person,
their familiarity with other platforms and to some extent their thinking out of
the box. Is the Sudoku solver iterative or recursive ? What if we're on an
embedded system and recursion is too heavy for it ? How much power does the
function require, how fast it works, etc.</p>
<p>A person that provides at least one answer in this category has bonus points
over the others who didn't. IMO it is very important for a tester to have
experience with various platforms and environments because this helps them
see edge cases which others will not be able to see. I also consider a strong
plus if the person shows they can operate outside their comfort zone.</p>
<p>If we have time I may ask the applicant to write the tests using a programming
language they know. This is to verify their coding and automation skills.</p>
<p>OTOH having the tests as code will show me how much the person knows about testing
vs. coding. I've seen solutions where people write a for loop, looping over all
numbers from 1 to 100 and testing if they are a valid input to <code>Sudoku()</code>.
Obviously this is pointless and they failed the test.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the question asks for testing a particular Sudoku solver
implementation. I expect the answers to be designed around the given function.
However I've seen answers designed around a
<a href="http://sudoku-solutions.com/">Sudoku solver website</a> or described as
intermediate states in an interactive Sudoku game (e.g. wrong answers shown in red).
I consider these invalid because the question is to test a particular
given function, not anything Sudoku related. If you do this in real-life that
means you are not testing the SUT directly but maybe touching it indirectly
(at best). This is not what a QA job is about.</p>
<h2>What Are The Correct Answers</h2>
<p>Here are some of the possible tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test with single dimensional input array - we expect an error;</li>
<li>Test with 3 dimensional input array - we expect an error;</li>
<li>Then proceed testing with 2 dimensional array;</li>
<li>Test with number less than 1 (usually 0) - expect error;</li>
<li>Test with number greater than 9 (usually 10) - expect error;</li>
<li>Test how the function handles non-numerical data - chars &amp; symbols
(essentially the same thing for our function);</li>
<li>Test with strings which actually represent a number, e.g. "1";</li>
<li>Test with floating point numbers, e.g. 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 - may or may not
work depending on how the code is written;</li>
<li>If floating point numbers are accepted, then test with a different locale.
Is "1.0" the same as "1,0";</li>
<li>Test with <code>null</code>, <code>nil</code>, <code>None</code> (whatever the language supports) -
this should be a valid value for unknown numbers and not cause a crash;</li>
<li>Test if the function validates that the provided input follows the
Sudoku rules by passing it duplicate numbers in one row, column or
square. It should produce an error;</li>
<li>Test if the input data contains the minimum number of givens, 17
for a general Sudoku, so that a solution can be found. Otherwise the function
may go into an
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/05/endless-loop-bug-candy-crush-saga-level-80/">endless loop</a>;</li>
<li>Verify the proposed solution conforms to Sudoku rules;</li>
<li>Test with a fully solved puzzle as input - output should be exactly the same;</li>
<li>If on mobile, measure battery consumption for 1 minute of operation. I've
seen a game which uses 1% battery power for 1 minute of game play;</li>
<li>Test for buffer overflows;</li>
<li>Test for speed of execution (performance);</li>
<li>Test performance on single and multiple (core) CPUs - depending on the
language and how the function is written this may produce a difference or not;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I'm missing something so please use the comments below to tell me your suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy testing!</p>

                    How To Hire Software Testers, Pt. 1
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Many people have asked me how do I make sure a person who applies for a
QA/software tester position is a good fit ? On the opposite side people
have asked online how do they give correct answers on test related questions
at job interviews. I have two general questions to help me decide if a
person knows about testing and if they are a good fit for the team or not.</p>
<p><img alt="Login form" src="/images/login_form_wireframe.jpg" title="Login form" /></p>
<h2>How do You Test a Login Form</h2>
<p>You are given the login form above and the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in is possible with username and password or through the social networks;</li>
<li>After successful registration an email with the following content is sent to the user:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Helo and welcome to atodorov.org! Click _here_ to confirm your emeil address.</code></p>
<p>You have 10 minutes to write down a list of all test cases you can think of!</p>
<h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
<p>The question looks trivial but isn't as easy to answer as you may think.
If you haven't spent the last 20 years of your life in a cave, chances are
that you will give technically correct answers but this is not the only
thing I'm looking for.</p>
<p>The question is designed to simulate a real-world scenario, where the QA
person is given a piece of software, or requirements document and tasked with
creating a test plan for it. The question is intentionally vague because that's
how real-world works, most often testers don't have all the requirements and
specifications available beforehand.</p>
<p>The time constrain, especially when the interview is performed in person,
simulates work under pressure - get the job done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>While I review the answers I'm trying to figure out how does the person think,
not how much about technology they know. I'm trying to figure out what are their
strong areas and where they need to improve. IMO being able to think as a tester
and having attention to details, being able to easily spot corner cases and
look at the problem from different angles is much more important than
technical knowledge in a particular domain.</p>
<p>As long as a person is suited to think like a tester they can learn to
apply their critical thinking to any software under test and use various
testing techniques to discover or safeguard against problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A person that answers quickly and intuitively is better than a person who
takes a long time to figure out what to test. I can see they are active
thinkers and can work without micro-management and hand-holding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person that goes on and on
describing different test cases is better than one who limits themselves to
the most obvious cases. I can see they have an exploratory passion, which
is the key to finding many bugs and making the software better;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person that goes to explore the system in breadth is better than one who
keeps banging on the same test case with more and more variations. I can see
they are noticing the various aspects of the software (e.g. social login,
email confirmation, etc) but also to some extent, not investing all of their
resources (the remaining time to answer) into a single direction. Also in
real-world testing, testing the crap out of something is useful up to a point.
Afterwards we don't really see any significant value from additional testing
efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person that is quick to figure out one or two corner cases is better
than a person who can't. This tells me they are thinking about what goes
on under the hood and trying to predict unpredictable behavior - for example
what happens if you try to register with already registered username or email?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person that asks questions in order to minimize uncertainty and vagueness
is better than the one who doesn't. In real-world if the tester doesn't know
something they have to ask. Quite often even developers and product managers
don't know the answer. Then how are we developing software if we don't know
what it is supposed to do ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If given more time (writing interview), a person that organizes their answers
into steps (1, 2, 3) is a bit better than one who simply throws at you random
answers without context. Similar thought applies to people who write down their
test pre-conditions before writing down scenarios. From this I can see that
the person is well organized and will have no trouble writing detailed test cases,
with pre-conditions, steps to execute and expected results. This is what QAs do.
Also we have the, sometimes tedious, task of organizing all test results into
a test case management system (aka test book) for further reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The question intentionally includes some mistakes. In this example 2 spelling
errors in the email text. Whoever manages to spot them and tell me about it is
better than others who don't spot the errors or assume that's how it is. QAs job
is to always question everything and never blindly trust that the state of the
system is the way it is. Also simple errors like typos can be
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/01/15/tesla-needs-more-qa/">embarrassing</a> or generate
unnecessary support calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bravo if you tested not only the outgoing email but also social login. This
shows attention to details, not to mention social is 1/3rd of our example system.
It also shows that QA's job doesn't end with testing
the core, perceived functionality of the system. QA tests everything,
even interactions with external systems if that is necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are The Correct Answers</h2>
<p>I will document some of the possible answers as I recall them from memory.
I will update the list with other interesting answers given by students who
applied to my
<a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101">QA and Automation 101</a>
course, answering this very same question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test if users can register using valid username, email and password;</li>
<li>Test if SUT gives an error message when email or password (or username)
format doesn't follow a particular format (e.g. no special symbols);</li>
<li>After registration, test that the user can login successfully;</li>
<li>Depending on requirements test if the user can login before they have
confirmed their email address;</li>
<li>Test that upon registration a confirmation email is actually sent;</li>
<li>Spell-check the email text;</li>
<li>Test if the <em>click here</em> piece of text is a hyperlink;</li>
<li>Verify that when clicked, the hyperlink successfully confirmed email/activates the account
(depending on what confirmed/activated means per requirements);</li>
<li>Test what happens if the link is clicked a second time;</li>
<li>Test what happens if the link is clicked after 24 or 48 hrs;</li>
<li>Test that the social network icons, actually link to the desired SN and
not someplace else;</li>
<li>Test if new user accounts can be created via all specified social networks;</li>
<li>Test what happens if there is an existing user, who registered with a password
and they (or somebody else) tries to register via social with an account that has
the same email address, aka account hijacking;</li>
<li>Same as previous test but try to register a new user, using email address that
was previously used with social login;</li>
<li>Test what happens if users forget their password - intentionally we don't have
the '[] Forgot my password' checkbox. This is both usability feature and missing
requirements;</li>
<li>Test for simple SQL injections like
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/images/fa7c5b5f326e3c4a6cc9db19e7edbaf0-xkcd-bobby-tables.png">Bobby Tables</a>.
<em>btw I was given this image as an answer which scored high on the geek-o-meter</em>;</li>
<li>Test for XSS - <a href="https://twitter.com/dergeruhn/status/476764918763749376">Tweetdeck didn't</a>;</li>
<li>Test if non-activated/non-confirmed usernames expire after some time and can be used again;</li>
<li>Test of fields tab order - something I haven't done in 15 or more years
but still valid and I've seen sites getting it wrong quite often;</li>
<li>When trying to login test what happens when username/password is wrong or empty;</li>
<li>Test if email is required for login - this isn't clear from the requirements
so it is a valid answer. Better answer is to clarify that;</li>
<li>Test if username/email or password is case sensitive. Valid test and indeed I
recently saw a problem where upon registration users entered their emails using
some capital letters but they were lower-cased before saving to the DB. Later this
broke a piece of code which forgot to apply the lowercase on the input data. The code
was handling account reactivation;</li>
<li>Test if the password field shows the actual password or not. I haven't seen this
in person but I'm certain there is some site which maybe used CSS and nice images
instead of the default ugly password field and that didn't work on all browsers;</li>
<li>Test if you can copy&amp;paste the masked password, probably trying to steal somebody
else's password. Last time I saw this was on early Windows 95 with the modem connection
dialog. Very briefly it allowed you to copy the text from the field and paste it into
Notepad to reveal the actual password;</li>
<li>If we're on mobile (intentionally not specified) test for buffer overflows;
Actually test that everywhere and see what happens;</li>
<li>Test if the social network buttons use the same action verb. In the example
we have <em>Log in</em>, <em>Connect</em> and <em>Sign in</em>. This is sort of usability testing
and helping have a unified look and feel of the product;</li>
<li>Test which of the <em>Log in</em> and <em>Sign up</em> tabs is active at the moment.
The example is intentionally left to look like a wireframe but it is important
for the user to easily tell where they are. Otherwise they'll call support or
even worse, simply give up on us;</li>
<li>Test if all static files (images) will load if they are deployed onto CDN.
Not surprisingly I've seen <a href="https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate/pull/80">this bug</a>;</li>
<li>In case we have a "[] Remember me" checkbox, test if it actually remembers
the user credentials. Yesterday I saw this same functionality not working on
a specialized desktop app in the corner case where you supply a different
connection endpoint (server) instead of the ones already provided. The user
defined value is accepted but not saved automatically;</li>
<li>Test if the "Remember me" functionality actually saves your last credentials
or only the first ones you provided. There is a similar bug in 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xevica.grajdanite">Grajdanite</a>,
where once you enter a wrong email, it is remembered and every time the form is
pre-filled with the previous value (which is wrong). I'm yet to report it though;</li>
<li>Cross-browser testing - hmm, login and registration should work on all browsers
you say. It's not browser dependent, is it? Well yeah, login isn't browser dependent
unless we did something stupid like pre-handling the form submit via non-cross-platform
JavaScript or even
<a href="https://github.com/gilsondev/pelican-clean-blog/pull/6">accidentally doing so</a>;</li>
<li>Test with Unicode characters, especially non Latin ones. It's been many years
since we had Unicode but quite a few apps haven't learned how to deal with Unicode
text properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm certain there are more answers and I will update the list as I figure them out.
You can always post in the comments and tell me something I've missed.</p>
<h2>How to Pass The Job Interview</h2>
<p>This is a question I often see on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Alexander-Todorov">Quora</a>.
<em>I have a job interview tomorrow. How do I test a login form (or whatever) ?</em></p>
<p>If this section is what you're after I suspect you are a junior or wanna-be
software tester. As you've seen the interviewer isn't really interested in what you know already,
at least not as much. We're interested in getting to know how you
think in the course of 30-60 minutes.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself being asked a similar question just start thinking and
answering and don't stop. Vocalize your thoughts, even if you don't know what will
happen when testing a certain condition. Then keep going on and on. Look at the problem
from all angles, explain how you'd test various aspects and features of the SUT.
Then move on to the next bit. Always think about what you may have forgotten and
revisit your answers - this is what real QAs do - learn from mistakes.
Ask questions, don't ever assume anything. If something is unclear ask to be
clarified. For example I've seen a person who doesn't use social networks and
didn't know how social login/registration worked. They did good by asking me to
describe how that works.</p>
<p>Your goal is to make the interviewer ask you to stop answering. Then tell them
a few more answers.</p>
<p>However beware of cheating. You may cheat a little bit by
saying you will test this and that or design scenarios you have no clue about.
Maybe you read them in my blog or elsewhere. If the interviewer knows their job
(which they should) they will instantly ask you another question to verify what
you say. Don't forget the interviewer is probably an experienced tester and validating
assumptions is what they do every day.</p>
<p>For example, if you told me something about security testing or SQL injection
or XSS I will ask you to explain that in more details. If you forgot to mention,
one of them, say XSS but only heard about SQL injection I will ask you about the
other one. This will immediately tell me if you have a clue what you are talking
about.</p>

<p>When I see a <code>.and_call_original</code> method
after a stub I immediately delete it because in most of the cases this isn't
necessary. Why stub out something just to call it again later ? See my comments
above. Also the <code>expect to receive &amp;&amp; do action</code>
sequence is a bit counter intuitive. I prefer the <code>do action &amp; assert results</code>
sequence instead.</p>
<p>The problem here comes from the fact that RSpec has very flexible syntax for
creating stubs which makes it very easy to abuse them, especially when you
have no idea what you're doing. If you write tests with RSpec please make a
note of this and try to avoid this mistake.</p>
