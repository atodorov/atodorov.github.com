                    Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers
                </h2>
            </a>
            <blockquote>
<p>Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don't have a good distribution strategy.</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen, venture capitalist</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N06Y2DW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00N06Y2DW&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=4GDHEYN66CPL7L72">Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00N06Y2DW" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
introduces startup founders and employees to the "Bullseye Framework," 
a five-step process successful companies use to get traction. 
This framework helps founders find the marketing channel that will be key to unlocking the next stage of growth. </p>
<p>Too often, startups building a product struggle with traction once they launch. 
This struggle has startups trying random tactics - some ads, a blog post or two - in an unstructured way that leads to failure. 
Traction shows readers how to systematically approach marketing, and covers how successful businesses have grown through each of
the following 19 channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viral Marketing</li>
<li>Public Relations (PR)</li>
<li>Unconventional PR</li>
<li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li>
<li>Social and Display Ads</li>
<li>Offline Ads</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Content Marketing</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Engineering as Marketing</li>
<li>Target Market Blogs</li>
<li>Business Development (BD)</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Affiliate Programs</li>
<li>Existing Platforms</li>
<li>Trade Shows</li>
<li>Offline Events</li>
<li>Speaking Engagements</li>
<li>Community Building </li>
</ul>
<p>The book is very easy to read and full of practical advice which should serve as a starting point and give you
more ideas how to approach a particular distribution channel. It took me two days to read and 
I already had some ideas to test even before reading the whole of it. My next steps are to apply the principles
to my current startup <a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">Obuvki 41 Plus</a> and a future one I have in mind.</p>
<p>To anyone building a startup of any kind I would recommend the following selection of books:</p>

by Timothy Ferriss is one of my all time favorite books.
The basic idea is to ditch the traditional working environment
and work less utilizing more automation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book starts with a story about the Tango World Championship semifinals in
Argentina and poses the question 
<em>“What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left my job and the U.S. over a year ago?”</em>
Can you answer this? Keep reading!</p>
<h2>Step 1: Definition</h2>
<p>Tim defines two groups of people. The Deferrers, those who save it all for the
end only to find that life has passed them by and the New Rich.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement
  to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the time, which frees him to
  practice cross-country skiing and take road trips with his family two weeks per
  month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers and projects,
  outsources all operations entirely, and travels the world collecting rare
  documents, all while working remotely on a website to showcase her own
  illustration work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to establish an online
  video rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche
  of Blu-ray aficionados, a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work
  full-time as an animal rights lobbyist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The possibilities are endless. What defines the New Rich is their unrestricted mobility
and availability of free time! Money alone doesn't count anymore. Its practical value is
multiplied by the <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>where</em> and with <em>whom</em> you do what you do.</p>
<p>From that point of view earning less money but spending far less time on that is
much more powerful than working 80 hours per week for a million dollars.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Elimination</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One does not accumulate but eliminate.
It is not daily increase but daily decrease.
The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity.</p>
<p>BRUCE LEE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this chapter Tim talks about developing selective ignorance of information,
the 80-20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>,
gives tips for faster reading and battling interruption like checking your e-mail
and smart phone.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Automation</h2>
<p>Outsourcing and technical automation are the keys here but there is more.
Tim talks about income autopilot - designing your income sources in such a way
so that they don't consume much of your time and continue to produce income
even after the initial time investment.</p>
<p>Think about the following: working a 9-to-5 job yields an income only during
office hours. Having written a book yields income whenever a copy is sold, which
is while you're asleep and long after the initial time investment required to
write the book.</p>
<p>Then you can diversify your income streams and voila - you're making money
automatically :)</p>
<p>Tim also refers to the business management side of things. Why become the
manager when you can be the owner of the business ? It's kind of hard to
let virtual assistants run your business and resolve issues for you but that
frees up your time which is more valuable.</p>
<p>In between he also mentions why as a business you should keep prices high!
Counter intuitive, isn't it? </p>
<p>This is easier said than done but I've been working on it for the last couple
of years and its starting to take shape nicely so there's truth to it.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Liberation</h2>
<p>This is the chapter which helps you escape the 9-5 office hours through some
interesting techniques. This is not only for freelancers like myself but also
for the regular employee. One of the principles is to ask for forgiveness,
not a permission (which will be denied anyway).</p>
<p>Another one boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase company investment into you so that the loss is greater if you quit,
e.g. corporate training;</li>
<li>Prove increased output offsite - call in sick Tuesday to Thursday but continue
working. Produce more and leave some sort of digital trail, emails, etc;</li>
<li>Prepare the quantifiable business benefit - you need to present remote working
as a good business decision and not a personal perk, for example you've managed to
bill more hours to your company's customers. As explanation use removal of commute
and fewer distractions from the office noise;</li>
<li>Propose a revocable trial period - plan everything that will be said but play it
cool and casual. You want to avoid the impression that remote working will be something
permanent (for now). Find a relaxed afternoon and give it a shot!</li>
<li>Expand remote time by making sure you're most productive on your days out of the
office and if need be lower the productivity inside the office a bit. Then give it
a shot for a longer trial period or more days working remotely;</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also another one called the hourglass approach, so named because you use a
long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote agreement and then negotiate
back up to full-time out of the office.</p>
<p>I personally had it easier in terms of remote working. Before I became a contractor
I've been working with folks in the US to whom it doesn't really matter whether I was
based in Czech Republic or in Bulgaria. Also I've been sick at that time and had an
important project to manage which all just played nicely in proving that I
can be productive in any location.</p>
<p>Then comes one of my favorite sections <em>Killing Your Job</em>. Boy you just have to read
this. Lots of people need to read this! Everything you are afraid of and keeps you from
quitting your job is total bulshit. There are always options. It might be emotionally
difficult, but you won’t starve!</p>
<h2>Extended edition</h2>
<p>This extended edition of the book completes with blog articles and bonus sections
like <em>Killing Your BlackBerry</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. 
Been doing this for seven years. Prior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W
(translate: work for work’s sake)</p>
<p>Crunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately
began taking Mondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend.
Tuesday to Friday I work 11 A.M.–4 P.M. (20 hours per week).</p>
<p>I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that
50% of the 80% was pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone
on my payroll.</p>
<p>I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync”.
Now it’s on a Tues–Fri, 11 A.M.–4 P.M. schedule.</p>
<p>My e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending
me meaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me.</p>

by Dale Carnegie teaches you how to deal with people. The book briefly explains
some easy to use principles, why and how they work and then provides tons of
real life examples behind those principles. This book is a must for everyone but
especially parents and teachers and folks in sales, management or business leaders.</p>
<p>I will only highlight the key points. What follows are direct quotes from the book.</p>
<h2>Part One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People</h2>
<p><em>'If You Want to Gather Honey, Don't Kick Over the Beehive'</em> - PRINCIPLE 1: Don't criticise, condemn or complain.</p>
<p><em>The Big Secret of Dealing with People</em> - PRINCIPLE 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p>
<p><em>'He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way'</em> - 
PRINCIPLE 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.</p>
<h2>Part Two: Six Ways to Make People Like You</h2>
<p><em>Do This and You'll Be Welcome Anywhere</em> - PRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.</p>
<p><em>A Simple Way to Make a Good First Impression</em> - PRINCIPLE 2: Smile.</p>
<p><em>If You Don't Do This, You Are Headed for Trouble</em> - PRINCIPLE 3: 
Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</p>
<p><em>An Easy Way to Become a Good Conversationalist</em> - PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. 
Encourage others to talk about themselves.</p>

                    I Want to Be a Robot - Book Review: The Singularity Is Near
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>I've just finished reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QCSA7C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000QCSA7C&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=PY5X54XVJXYLZBIH">The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000QCSA7C" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and all I have to say is "I want to be a robot"!</p>
<p>This is one of the books that took me the longest time to read. It's a hard
to read book because it is full of technical and scientific details, quotes
a great deal of facts and research and leads your mind into fields which
deserve a separate books for themselves.</p>
<p>The purely technical side of the book makes it a bit hard to follow as you need
to have a good deal of understanding of computing technology and concepts and
keep in mind what's been said in previous chapters.</p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil starts with historical data about evolution and technological
progress. He postulates his theory of technology evolution called
"The Law of Accelerating Returns" and lists a great deal of examples to prove
that evolutionary processes are indeed not linear but exponential.</p>
<p>The next two chapters explain how much is the computational capacity of the
human brain, how to achieve that and how to reverse engineer the brain itself.
Think about 3-D molecular computing, quantum computing, brain imaging and scanning :)</p>
<p>Increased computing capacity and understanding of the human brain 
(and general progress of science and technology in the mean time)
will lead to the three revolutions which will make the Singularity possible:
Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics (Strong AI). Ray gives a lot of
examples and current research which is well under way currently or
will become a reality in the next 10 to 30 years.</p>
<p>Following in the book is a list of impacts caused by the advancement of
technology and the Singularity itself. On the human body and brain, on
longevity, on warfare, on work and learning and play, on the Cosmos.</p>
<p>Because the Singularity is not a single event but rather many events which
happen in parallel and gradually over time we will have a hard time defining
what a human means. What is human, what is consciousness and where the line is
are questions which need to be taken into consideration. Ultimately the human
race will become (predominantly) non-biological.</p>
<p>How do you deal with dangers and shortcomings in technology? I myself as a QA
engineer have seen software fail in spectacular ways. How about machine failures? 
Now how about nanobots in your blood stream or strong AI gone wild? Ray explains
some of the possible threats and proposals to overcome them. His point is
that benefits from advanced technology will be far greater than dangers and
we will be able to first design our defense systems before anything else that
may threaten our existence. </p>
<p>The last chapter contains examples of criticism and explanations why they
are incorrect which is the first of its kind I've seen in a book.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Human Centrality. A common view is that science has consistently been correcting our overly inflated view of our
own significance. Stephen Jay Gould said, "The most important scientific revolutions all include, as their only
common feature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previous convictions about
our centrality in the cosmos."</p>
<p>But it turns out that we are central, after all. Our ability to create models-virtual realities-in our brains, combined
with our modest-looking thumbs, has been sufficient to usher in another form of evolution: technology. That
development enabled the persistence of the accelerating pace that started with biological evolution. It will continue
until the entire universe is at our fingertips.</p>

                    Book Review - Last 3 Months
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Hello folks, this is my book list for the past 3 months. It ranges from
tech and start-up related to Japanese and kid stories. Here's my quick review.</p>
<h2>Lean UX</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449311652/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449311652&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=JNQIKHJJXU3KJ33H">Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449311652" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
is the second book I read on the subject after first reading
<a href="/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/">UX for Lean Startups</a>.</p>
<p>It is published before <em>UX for Lean Startups</em> and is much more about principles than
any practical methods. Honestly I'm not sure if I took any real value out of it.
Maybe if I had read these two books in reverse order it would have been better.</p>
<h2>The Hacienda - How Not to Run a Club</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DEKLESK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DEKLESK&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=FOMGYFQW4BHGPPOL">The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DEKLESK" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Peter Hook is one of my favorites. It covers a great deal of music and clubland history,
depicts crazy parties and describes the adventure of owning one of the most
popular nightclubs in the world. All of that while struggling to make a buck and
pouring countless pounds into a black hole.</p>
<p>The irony is The Hacienda became a legendary place only after it had closed down
and later on being demolished.</p>
<p>A must read for anyone who is considering business in the entertainment industry
or wants to read a piece of history. My favorite quote of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years after, Tony Wilson found himself sitting opposite Madonna at dinner.</p>
<p>‘I eventually plucked up the courage to look across the table to Madonna and ask,
“Are you aware that the first place you appeared outside of New York was our club in Manchester?”</p>
<p>‘She gave me an ice-cold stare and said, “My memory seems to have wiped that.”’</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Simple Science Experiments</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0713428945/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0713428945&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=HU6TVCNR6DG67EFG">Simple Science Experiments</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0713428945" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Hans Jürgen Press is a very old book listing 200 experiments which you can
do at home using household materials. It is great for teaching basic science
to children. The book is very popular and is available in many languages
and editions - just search for it.</p>
<p>I used to have this as a kid and was able to purchase the 1987 Bulgarian edition
at an antique bookstore in Varna two months ago.</p>
<h2>Ronia, the Robber's Daughter</h2>
<p>Decided to experiment a little bit and found
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140317201/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140317201&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=FDHOPXQCZPMYCAA2">Ronia, the Robber's Daughter</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0140317201" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
It's a child's book telling the story of two kids whose fathers are rival
robbers. The book is an easy read (2-3 hrs before bed time) with stories
of magic woods, dwarfs and scary creatures mixed with human emotions
and the good vs. bad theme.</p>
<h2>Japanese Short Stories</h2>
<p>I've managed to find a 1973 compilation of Japanese short stories
translated into Bulgarian. Also one of my favorite books.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken these are classic
Japanese authors, nothing modern or cutting edge. Most of the action happens
during the early 1900s as far as I can tell.
What impresses me most is the detailed description of nature and
surrounding details in all of the stories.</p>
<h2>The Singularity Is Near</h2>
<p>I've also started 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143037889&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=BKMQ47NQEXNTDDRR">The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0143037889" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>It's a bit hard to read because the book is full of so many technical details
about genetics, nanotechnology, robotics and AI.</p>
<p>Ray depicts a bright future where humans will transcend our biological
limitations and essentially become pure intelligence. Definitely a good
read and I will tell you more about it when I finish it.</p>

                    Book Review - January 2014
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Sorry for not being able to write anything this month. I've been very sick
and hardly even touched a computer in the last few weeks. I promise to make
it up to you next month. Until then here's the books I've managed to read in
January.</p>
<h2>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1erRrnb">Hooked</a> is an ebook for Kindle which I luckily got for
free on NYE (it's paid now). The book describes the so called "Hook Model"
which is a guide to building products people can’t put down. </p>
<p>The book goes through a cycle of <strong>trigger</strong>, <strong>action</strong>, <strong>variable reward</strong> and
<strong>investment</strong> to describe how one can design a product which users keep using
without you doing anything (pretty much). There are plenty of examples with products
like Instagram and Pinterest.</p>
<p>I really find the book interesting and will strongly recommend it as a must read
to anyone who is building a product. If you're thinking about a mobile app or an
online service this book is definitely for you.</p>
<h2>CyberJoly Drim</h2>
<p><a href="http://hell.pl/nina/carramba.htm">CyberJoly Drim</a> is a 1998 cyber punk story by
Polish writer Antonina Liedtke. One I've heard about through the years but found
just recently. It's about a love story although everything else is fiction. PDF format
is around 30 pages.</p>
<p>I found it hard to read especially b/c my Polish is totally rusty (not to mention I hardly
understand it) and Google translate didn't manage well neither. Anyway, not a bad read
before bed time if you like this kind of stuff.</p>
<h2>The First in Bulgarian Internet</h2>
<p>Last a book about 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13398350">Bulgarian Internet pioneers</a>. The book
compiles a great deal with historical data as well as interviews and web site descriptions.
It's said to mention about 400 persons. </p>
<p>The events start around 1989 with the BBS systems at the time and the first one to appear in
the country with accounts of first time logging into the network and pretty much seeing a
computer. Then it goes to tell the story of first companies and Internet providers, how they
started business, how they grew and formed the country's backbone infrastructure. There's
lots of personal memories and stories as well. This goes to about 2002 when the book
was written.</p>
<p>The second part of the book mostly describes various websites, some of the first ones and
some milestone or famous ones. It's organized by date of website launch but isn't that much
interesting. I find the local contents at the time a bit boring.</p>
<p>The book isn't what I initially expected - I wanted more personal stories and more news from
the kitchen. It's not that, it looks to me the people who were interviewed had chosen their
words very carefully and didn't reveal any sensational stories.</p>
<p>The nice thing about all of that is I've started using the web in early 1998 and remember
most of the events and websites described in the book. It's good to remember the history.
I own the book and can give it to you if you like. It's on the <a href="/blog/2013/04/05/give-away-list/">Give Away</a>
list.</p>
<p>I hope you find something interesting to read in my library. If not please share what did you
read this month.</p>
<hr />
<p>PS: I'm currently in Milan and will be visiting FOSDEM at the end of the week. Catch
you there if you're coming.</p>

                    Book Review of 2013
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Happy New Year everyone! I was able to complete reading a few books in the last
days so this first post will be a quick review of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16191345-alexander-todorov?read_at=2013&amp;view=covers">all twelve books I've read in 2013</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Blogging</h2>
<p>I've started the year with 
<a href="http://amzn.to/1a2QySD">Technical Blogging: Turn Your Expertise into a Remarkable Online Presence</a>
by Antonio Cangiano. This is the book which prompted me to start this blog. It is
targeted primarily at technical blogging but could be useful to non-tech bloggers as well.
I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is writing for the web.</p>
<h2>The 4-Hour Workweek</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1ivu2q4">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a>
by Timothy Ferriss. This book I found at a local 
<a href="/blog/2013/01/30/startup-talk-5-book-list/">start-up event</a> and is one of my
all time favorites. The basic idea is to ditch the traditional working space and
work less utilizing more automation. This is something I've been doing to an extent
during the last 5+ years and I am still changing my life and working habits to 
reach the moment where I work only a few hours a week.</p>
<p>A must read for any entrepreneur, freelancer or work from home folks.</p>
<h2>The E-Myth Revisited</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1d0j5ee">The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It</a>
by Michael Gerber is the second book I've found at the same start-up event mentioned
previously. I found this one particularly hard to read. What I took from it was
that you should think about your business as a franchise and document processes
so that others can do it for you in the same way you would do it yourself.</p>
<h2>Culture and Wine</h2>
<p>Next two books are in Bulgarian and can be found at my 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16191345-alexander-todorov?read_at=2013&amp;view=covers">Goodreads list</a>.
They are about culture and religion and wine tasting 101.</p>
<h2>Accelerando</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/19Ctnk8">Accelerando (Singularity)</a> by Charles Stross is also one
of my favorites. I've heard about it at a local CloudFoundry conference a few years
back and finally had the time to read it. This is a fiction book where events start
in the near future and drive forward to dismantling the planets in the Solar system,
uploading lobsters minds on the Internet, space travel, aliens and family
relationships. I will definitely recommend it, the book is a very relaxing read.</p>
<h2>DevOps</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1eXk3JN">What Is DevOps?</a> by Mike Loukides and
<a href="http://amzn.to/19KobFn">Building a DevOps Culture</a> by Mandi Walls are two short
free books for Kindle. They just touch base on the topic of DevOps and what it
takes to create a DevOps organization. Definitely worth reading even if you're
not deeply interested in this topic. </p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1dVvQmE">DevOps for Developers</a> by Michael Huttermann is a
practical books about DevOps. It talks about processes and tools and lists
lots of examples. The tools part is Ruby centric though.
I found it a bit hard to read at times and it took me a while
to complete it. I'm not sure if the book is really helpful if one decides to
change an exiting organization to a DevOps like structure but it is definitely
a starting point. </p>
<p>The days of waterfall software development are gone and knowingly or not most of
us work in a DevOps like environment these days. I think it's worth at least skimming
through this book and taking some essentials from it. </p>
<h2>UX For Lean Startups</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a> by Laura Klein is a very good book
about designing user experience and validation which I've
<a href="/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/">reviewed previously</a>.
I strongly recommend this book to everyone who is building a product of some sort.</p>
<h2>Bulgarian Comics</h2>
<p>At the end of the year I've managed to read two comics books, both in Bulgarian.
The first one is a brief history of the comics arts in the country in the past 150
years with lots of references to good old stories which I've read when I was a kid.</p>
<p>The second one is a special edition (ebook only, print edition is out of stock) of
the popular Daga (Rainbow) magazine which ceased to exist 20 years ago. There are
some new episodes of the old stories drawn by the original artists.</p>
<p>Both books seem to be a turning point in Bulgarian comics art and market. Hopefully
we'll see more cool stuff in the future. These books are not available on Amazon
but there are some <a href="http://amzn.to/19Cw6tV">free comics books for Kindle</a> which
you may give a try.</p>
<p>I hope you find something interesting to read in my list. Also feel free to comment
and share your favorite books in the comments below.</p>

                    Book Review: UX for Lean Startups
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>Recently I've finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a>
and strongly recommend this book to anyone who is <strong>OR</strong> wants to be an
entrepreneur. Here is a short review of the book.</p>
<p>This book is for anyone who is creating a product/service or is considering the
idea of doing so. It talks about validation, interaction design and subsequent
product measurement and iteration. The book demonstrates some techniques and tools
to validate, design and measure your business ideas and products.
Its goal is to teach you how to design products that deliver fantastic user
experience, e.g. ones that are intuitive and easy to use.
It has nothing to do with visual design. </p>
<p>The author Laura Klein summarizes the book as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User research</p>
<p>Listen to your users. All the time. I mean it.</p>
<p>Validation</p>
<p>When you make assumptions or create hypotheses,
  test them before spending lots of time building products around them.</p>
<p>Design</p>
<p>Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Early Validation</h2>
<p>This chapter helped me a lot to understand what exactly is validation and how
to go about it. The flow is validating the problem you are trying to solve,
then the market and then the product. </p>
<p>I will also add that by using some of these research techniques around a
vague idea/area of interest you may come around a particular trend/pattern or problem 
and develop your business from there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve validated a problem when you start to hear
particular groups of people complaining about something specific.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Your goal in validating your market is to begin to narrow down the
group of people who will want their problems solved badly enough to buy
your product. Your secondary goal is to understand exactly why they’re
interested so you can find other markets that might be similarly motivated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve successfully validated your market when you can
accurately predict that a particular type of person will have a specific
problem and that the problem will be severe enough that that person is
interested in purchasing a solution.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Just because you have discovered a real problem and have a group of people
willing to pay you to solve their problem, that doesn’t necessarily mean that
your product is the right solution. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You’ll know that you’ve validated your product when a large percentage of
your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>Next few chapters talk about user research, the various kinds of it and when/how
to perform it. It talks how to properly run surveys, how to ask good questions,
etc. </p>
<h2>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative research is about measuring what real people are actually
doing with your product. It doesn’t involve speaking with specific humans.
It’s about the data in aggregate. It should always be statistically significant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Quantitative research tells you <strong>what</strong> your problem is. Qualitative
research tells you <strong>why</strong> you have that problem.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you want to measure something that exists, like traffic or revenue or how
many people click on a particular button, then you want quantitative data.
If you want to know why you lose people out of your purchase funnel or
why people all leave once they hit a specific page, or why people seem not
to click that button, then you need qualitative.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Part Two: Design</h2>
<p>The second part of this book talks about design - everything from building a
prototype to figuring out when you don’t want one. It assumes you have validated
the initial idea and now move on to designing the product and validating that
design before you start building it. It talks about diagrams, sketches, wireframes,
prototypes and of course MVPs.</p>
<p>I think you can safely skip some of these steps when it comes to small applications
because it may be easier/faster to build the application instead of a prototype.
Definitely not to be skipped if you're building a more complex product!</p>
<h2>Part Three: Product</h2>
<p>This section talks about metrics and measuring the product once it is out of the door.
Supposedly based on these metrics you will refine your design and update the product
accordingly.  Most of the time it focuses on A/B testing and which metrics are
important and which are so called "vanity metrics".</p>
<p>I particularly liked the examples of A/B testing and explanations what it is good for
and what it does poorly. Definitely a mistake I've happened to made myself. I'm sure you too.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have read this book and what your thoughts are. Thanks!</p>

                    Tip: Save Money on Amazon - Buy Used Books
                </h2>
            </a>
            <p>I like to buy books, the real ones, printed on paper. This however comes at
a certain price when buying from Amazon. The book price itself is
usually bearable but many times shipping costs to Bulgaria
will double the price. Especially if you are making a single book order.</p>
<p>To save money I started buying used books when available. For books that are
not so popular I look for items that have been owned by a library.</p>
<p>This is how I got a hardcover 1984 edition of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190676820X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=190676820X&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">The Gentlemen's Clubs of London</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=190676820X" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Anthony Lejeune for $10. This is my best deal so far.
The book was brand new I dare to say. There was no edge wear, no damaged pages,
with nice and vibrant colors. The second page had the library sign and no other marks.</p>
<p>Let me know if you had an experience buying used books online? Did you score a great
deal like I did?</p>
