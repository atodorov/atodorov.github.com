    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beware if using Amazon Simple Queue Service to send email messages!
Sometime SQS messages are duplicated which results in multiple copies of
the messages being sent. This happened today at <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>
and is really annoying to users. In this post I will explain why there is no easy
way of fixing it.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Q: Can a deleted message be received again?</p></p><p><p>Yes, under rare circumstances you might receive a previously deleted message again.<br/>This can occur in the rare situation in which a DeleteMessage operation doesn't<br/>delete all copies of a message because one of the servers in the distributed<br/>Amazon SQS system isn't available at the time of the deletion. That message copy<br/>can then be delivered again. You should design your application so that no errors<br/>or inconsistencies occur if you receive a deleted message again.</p><footer><strong>Amazon FAQ</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In my case the cron scheduler logs say:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;AsyncResult: a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While on the worker nodes the logs say:</p>

<pre><code>[2013-12-06 10:13:06,229: INFO/MainProcess] Got task from broker: tasks.cron_monthly_email_reminder[a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a]
[2013-12-06 10:18:09,456: INFO/MainProcess] Got task from broker: tasks.cron_monthly_email_reminder[a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a]
</code></pre>

<p>This clearly shows the same message (see the UUID) has been processed twice!
This resulted in hundreds of duplicate emails :(.</p>

<h2>Why This Is Hard To Fix</h2>

<p>There are two basic approaches to solve this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check some log files or database for previous record of the message having
been processed;</li>
<li>Use idempotent operations that if you process the message again, you
get the same results, and that those results don't create duplicate files/records.</li>
</ul>


<p>The problem with checking for duplicate messages is:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a race condition between marking the message as processed and the
second check;</li>
<li>You need to use some sort of locking mechanism to safe-guard against the race condition;</li>
<li>In the event of an eventual consistency of the log/DB you can't guarantee that
the previous attempt will show up and so can't guarantee that you won't process
the message twice.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above don't seem to work well for distributed applications not to mention
Difio processes millions of messages per month, per node and the logs are quite big.</p>

<p>The second option is to have control of the Message-Id or some other email header
so that the second message will be discarded either at the server (Amazon SES in my case)
or at the receiving MUA. I like this better but I don't think it is technically possible
with the current environment. Need to check though.</p>

<p>I've asked AWS support to look into
<a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=140782">this thread</a> and hopefully
they will have some more hints. If you have any other ideas please post in the comments!
Thanks!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-31T21:55:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/logos/obuvki41plus_header.png" title="header image" alt="header image" /></p>

<p>This is a simple story about a website I helped create without using any
programming at all. It took me two days because of the images and the logo
design which I've commissioned to a friend.</p>

<p>The website is <a href="http://obuvki41plus.com/">obuvki41plus.com</a> which is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus (hard to find in Bulgaria),
hence the name.</p>

<h2>Required Functionality</h2>

<ul>
<li>Display a catalog of items for sale with detailed information about
each item;</li>
<li>Make it possible for people to comment and share the items;</li>
<li>Very basic shopping cart which stores the selected items and then
redirects to a page with order instructions. Actual order is made via
phone for several reasons which I will explain in
<a href="/blog/2013/08/01/why-taking-orders-by-phone-works-for-my-start-up/">another post</a>;</li>
<li>Add a feedback/contact form;</li>
<li>Look nice on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technology</h2>

<ul>
<li>The website is static, all pages are simple HTML and is hosted in
Amazon S3;</li>
<li>Comments are provided by Facebook's
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Comments Box</a>
plug-in;</li>
<li>Social media buttons and tracking are provided by
<a href="https://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a>;</li>
<li>Visitors analytics is standard and is from
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>;</li>
<li>Template is from <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with slight
modifications; Works on mobile too;</li>
<li>Logo is custom designed by my friend
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aluinpoli">Polina Valerieva</a>;</li>
<li>Feedback/contact form is by <a href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>;</li>
<li>Shopping cart is by <a href="http://simplecartjs.org/">simpleCart(js)</a>.
I've created a simple animation effect when pressing the "ADD TO CART"
link to visually alert the user. This is done with jQuery.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could have used some JavaScript templating engine like
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> but at the time I didn't know about
it and I prefer not to write JavaScript if possible :).</p>

<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>I did some coding after the initial release eventually.
I've transformed the website to a Django
based site which is exported as static HTML.</p>

<p>This helps me with faster deployment/management as everything is stored
in git, allows templates inheritance and also makes the site ready to
add more functionality if required.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/29/what-runs-your-startup-imagga/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-29T12:32:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/29/what-runs-your-startup-imagga</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/startup/imagga.png" alt="Imagga" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a> is a cloud platform that helps businesses and
individuals organize their images in a fast and cost-effective way. They
develop a range of advanced proprietary image recognition and image processing
technologies, which are built into several services such as smart image
cropping, color extraction and multi-color search, visual similarity search and
auto-tagging.</p>

<p>During
<a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">Balkan Venture Forum</a>
in Sofia I sat down with Georgi Kadrev to talk about technology.
Surprisingly this hi-tech service is built on top of standard low-tech components
and lots of hard work.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Core functionality is developed in C and C++ with the OpenCV library.
Imagga relies heavily on own image processing algorithms for their core
features. These were built as a combination of their own research activities
and publications from other researchers.</p>

<p>Image processing is executed by worker nodes configured with their own
software stack. Nodes are distributed among Amazon EC2 and other data centers.</p>

<p>Client libraries to access Imagga API are available in PHP, Ruby and Java.</p>

<p>Imagga has built several websites to showcase their technology.
<a href="http://cropp.me/">Cropp.me</a>, <a href="http://colorslike.me/">ColorsLike.me</a>,
<a href="http://www.stockpodium.com">StockPodium</a> and <a href="http://autotag.me/">AutoTag.me</a>
were built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery above a standard LAMP stack.</p>

<p>Recently Imagga also started using GPU computing with nVidia Tesla cards.
They use C++ and Python bindings for
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda">CUDA</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>As an initially bootstrapping start-up we chose something that is basically free,<br/>reliable and popular - that's why started with the LAMP stack. It proved to be<br/>stable and convenient for our web needs and we preserved it.<br/>The use of C++ is a natural choice for computational intensive tasks that we<br/>need to perform for the purpose of our core expertise - image processing.<br/>Though we initially wrote the whole core technology code from scratch, we later<br/>switched to OpenCV for some of the building blocks as it is very well optimized<br/>and continuously extended image processing library.</p></p><p><p>With the raise of affordable high-performance GPU processors and their availability<br/>in server instances, we decided it's time to take advantage of this highly parallel<br/>architecture, perfectly suitable for image processing tasks.</p><footer><strong>Georgi Kadrev</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<h2>Want More Info?</h2>

<p>If you’d like to hear more from Imagga please comment below.
I will ask them to follow this thread and reply to your questions.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/06/26/performance-test-amazon-elasticache-vs-amazon-s3/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-26T21:22:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/06/26/performance-test-amazon-elasticache-vs-amazon-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Which Django cache backend is faster? Amazon ElastiCache or Amazon S3 ?</p>

<p>Previously I've mentioned about
<a href="/blog/2013/06/19/django-tips-using-cache-for-stateful-http/">using Django's cache to keep state between HTTP requests</a>.
In my demo described there I was using <a href="http://github.com/atodorov/django-s3-cache">django-s3-cache</a>.
It is time to move to production so I decided to measure the performance difference between the two
cache options available at Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2013-07-01</strong>: my initial test may have been false since I had not configured
ElastiCache access properly. I saw no errors but discovered the issue today on another
system which was failing to store the cache keys but didn't show any errors either.
I've re-run the tests and updated times are shown below.</p>

<h2>Test infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
<li>One Amazon S3 bucket, located in US Standard (aka US East) region;</li>
<li>One Amazon ElastiCache cluster with one Small Cache Node (cache.m1.small) with Moderate I/O capacity;</li>
<li>One Amazon Elasticache cluster with one Large Cache Node (cache.m1.large) with High I/O Capacity;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> I've tested both <code>python-memcached</code> and <code>pylibmc</code> client libraries for Django;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Test is executed from an EC2 node in the us-east-1a availability zone;</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Cache clusters are in the us-east-1a availability zone.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Test Scenario</h2>

<p>The test platform is Django. I've created a
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/Amazon-ElastiCache-vs-Amazon-S3-Django">skeleton project</a>
with only <code>CACHES</code> settings
defined and necessary dependencies installed. A file called <code>test.py</code> holds the
test cases, which use the standard timeit module. The object which is stored in cache
is very small - it holds a phone/address identifiers and couple of user made selections.
The code looks like this:</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>As expected ElastiCache is much faster (10x) compared to S3. However the difference
between the two ElastiCache node types is subtle. I will stay with the smallest
possible node to minimize costs. Also as seen, pylibmc is a bit faster compared to
the pure Python implementation.</p>

<p>Depending on your objects size or how many set/get operations you perform per
second you may need to go with the larger nodes. Just test it!</p>

<p><del>It surprised me how slow django-s3-cache is.</del>
The false test showed django-s3-cache to be 100x slower but new results are better.
10x decrease in performance sounds about right for a filesystem backed cache.</p>

<p>A quick look at the code
of the two backends shows some differences. The one I immediately see is that
for every cache key django-s3-cache creates an sha1 hash which is used as the
storage file name. This was modeled after the filesystem backend but I think the
design is wrong - the memcached backends don't do this.</p>

<p>Another one is that django-s3-cache time-stamps all objects and uses pickle to serialize them.
I wonder if it can't just write them as binary blobs directly. There's definitely lots
of room for improvement of django-s3-cache. I will let you know my findings once I
get to it.</p>

<p>Twilio is a cloud vendor that provides telephony services.
It can download and <code>&lt;Play&gt;</code> arbitrary audio files and will cache the files
for better performance.</p>

<p>Twilio support told me they are not disclosing the location of their servers,
so from my web application hosted in AWS US East:

<p>The <code>ip-*.ec2.internal</code> are clearly in US East. The <code>domU-*.computer-1.internal</code> also
look like US East although I'm not 100% sure what is the difference between the two.
The later ones look like HVM guests while the former ones are para-virtualized.</p>

<p>For comparison here are some internal addresses from my own EC2 systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>ip-10-228-237-207.eu-west-1.compute.internal - EU Ireland</li>
<li>ip-10-248-19-46.us-west-2.compute.internal - US West Oregon</li>
<li>ip-10-160-58-141.us-west-1.compute.internal - US West N. California</li>
</ul>


<p>After relocating my audio files to an S3 bucket in US East the average call length
dropped from 2:30 min to 2:00 min for the same IVR choices. This also minimizes
the costs since Twilio charges per minute of incoming/outgoing calls.
I think the audio quality has improved as well.</p>
