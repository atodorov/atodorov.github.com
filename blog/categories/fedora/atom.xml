<p>Here is my summary of the second Fedora Test Day hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Local attendance was a total disaster, in fact I was testing once again by my own.
This time
there were more people in the lab, all busy with their daily routines and tasks.
There were no people who came for the testing :(. I will have to try different
venues in the future and see if the situation improves.</p>

<p>On the testing front I managed to score 5 bugs against
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=709797,709799,709806,709810">GNOME</a>
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017807">Fedora</a>.
You can see the other test results and bugs on the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-10_Gnome_3.10">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>There are two things I didn't like in particular</p>

<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 as well as its classic mode - simply not the environment I'm used to;</li>
<li>Having to record test results in the wiki! I'm writing to the Fedora QA
mailing list about that as we speak.</li>
</ul>


<p>At one time I was engaged in a discussion about which Bulgarian keyboard layout
should be the default in GNOME simply because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709799">GNOME #709799</a>. The default
keyboard layout will be Bulgarian (traditional phonetic) aka bg+phonetic.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>(16,13,26) rtcm: atodorov: are you bulgarian and/or live in bulgaria?<br/>(16,14,20) rtcm: atodorov: if yes, I wanted to know which keyboard layout most people expect there to be the default<br/>(16,16,34) atodorov: rtcm: I'm a Bulgarian, however I can't tell which one. Both Phonetic and standard (BDS) are common<br/>(16,16,54) atodorov: a safe bet is to go with phonetic I guess.<br/>(16,19,46) rtcm: atodorov: can you tell me which one is it in XKB terms? is it "bg", "bg+bas_phonetic" or "bg+phonetic" ?<br/>(16,20,51) rtcm: they're labeled as "Bulgarian", "Bulgarian (new phonetic)" and "Bulgarian (traditional phonetic)"<br/>(16,21,30) atodorov: bg+phonetic is the traditional phonetic<br/>(16,22,04) atodorov: bg labeled as "Bulgarian" is the standard one I guess. Here we call it BDS after the standardization institute<br/>(16,22,34) atodorov: bg+bas_phonetic is created from the Bulgarian Academy of Science and is not very popular as far as I know. I've never seen it in use<br/>(16,23,15) rtcm: atodorov: all I want to know is what most people would expect? like what does windows do by default? that's a good bet<br/>(16,27,46) atodorov: rtcm: I'm just being told that new Windows releases use yet another layout by default, which is like phonetic but with some characters in new places and people don't like that<br/>(16,27,53) atodorov: my safe bet goes to bg+phonetic<br/>(16,29,05) rtcm: ok, thanks</p></blockquote></p>

<p>It is a rare occasion when you get to make a decision that affects a large group
of people and I hope you don't hate me for that!</p>

<p>Do you want to see more Fedora Test Days happening in Sofia? Join me and I will
organize some more!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/fedora/fedora20-banner.png" title="Fedora 20 banner" alt="&quot;Fedora 20 banner&quot;" /></p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of the first Fedora Test Day in Sofia I hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> today.</p>

<p>Attendance was quite poor, actually nobody else except me participated but
almost nobody else visited the hackespace as well. I get that it is a
working day and Test Days conflict with regular business hours but this
is not going to change anyway. On the other hand where were all the freelancers
and non-office job workers who usually hang around in the Lab? I have no idea!</p>

<p>On IRC there was much better activity, 5 or 6 people were testing across
Asia, Europe and USA time zones. You can see the test results
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">here</a>.
I've started filing quite a few bugs in the morning and continued well into the
afternoon. I've managed to file a total of
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1016435,1016449,1016488,1016530,1016604,1016613,1016648,1016663,1016704,1016715">10 bugs</a>.
Some of them were not related to virtualization and some of them turned out to be
duplicates or not a bug. I even managed to file 2 duplicate bugs which likely have the
same root cause myself :).</p>

<p>I've also experienced two bugs filed by other people:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967371">RHBZ #967371</a> for MATE desktop
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1015636">RHBZ #1015636</a> for
virt-manager's Save/Restore functionality.</p>

<p>I've tried ARM on x86_64 but that didn't get anywhere near a running system.
I will make another post about ARM and what I've discovered there.</p>

<p>The one thing I liked is the
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">test results application</a>.
It is not what I'm used to when dealing with RHEL, has far less features but is
very fast and easy to use and suits the Test Days participants just fine.
And is definitely much easier to use compared to filing results in the wiki.</p>

<p>Overall Fedora 20 virtualization status according to me is pretty good.</p>

<p>I hope to see more attendance <a href="http://initlab.org/event/gnome-test-day">on Thursday</a>
when we're going to test GNOME 3.10.</p>

    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/14/upcoming-talk-fedora-test-days-in-sofia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick
some developers' ass this is the way to do it!</p>

<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov's „Oracle's take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

<p>PS: this post was initially written on my <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>
with Penzus Editor - another small step in
<a href="/blog/2013/08/01/laptop-vs-smartphone-part-one/">retiring my laptop</a>.</p>
