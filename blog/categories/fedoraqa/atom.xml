&lt;p&gt;In early December'16 together with my 5 year old daughter we visited an introductory workshop
about the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; book and another
workshop organized by &lt;a href="http://coderdojobulgaria.com/"&gt;Coder Dojo Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.
Later that month we also visited a &lt;a href="http://www.roboleague.bg/"&gt;Robo League&lt;/a&gt;
competition in Sofia.
The goal was to further Adriana's interest into technical topics and programming in
particular and see how she will respond to the topics covered and the
workshops and training materials format in general. I have been keeping
detailed notes and today I'm publishing some of my observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events that we visited were strictly for small children and there were mentors
who worked with the kids. Each mentor, depending on the event works with up to 4 or 5
children. Parents were not allowed to interfere and I have been keeping
my distance on purpose, trying to observe and document as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; is a small book with colorful illustrations
about a girl who embarks on adventures in programming. Adriana considers it a fairy tale
although the book introduces lots of IT related terms - Ruby and gems, Firefox,
Snow Leopard, Django, etc. For a child these don't necessarily mean anything
but she was able to recognize my Red Hat fedora which was depicted on one of the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop itself was the introduction of the Bulgarian translation, which I've purchased,
and had the kids build a laptop using glue and paper icons. Mentors were explaining
to the children what the various icons mean, that viruses are a bad thing for your computer,
what a CPU and computer memory are
and everything else in between. A month later when Adriana started building a new
paper computer on her own (without being provoked by me) she told me that the
colored icons were "information" that goes into the computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the story part of the book there are exercises designed to create analytical
thinking. We did only a few in the beginning where she had to create a list of
action sequence how to make the bed or get dressed up in the morning, etc. At the time
Adriana didn't receive the game very well and was having some troubles figuring out
the smaller actions that comprise a larger activity. We didn't follow through with
the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code.org&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the second event she was exposed to &lt;a href="https://studio.code.org/"&gt;studio.code.org&lt;/a&gt;!
At the time we were required to bring a working laptop and a mouse. I had no idea
how these were going to be used. It turned out mentors gave each child a training
course from code.org according to their age. Adriana started with the Course #1
because she can't read on her own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seemed to me that Adi was a bit bored and didn't know what to do,
staring cluelessly at the screen. Btw this was her first session working with
a computer on her own. After a while the mentor came and I guess explained what
needs to be done, how the controls work and what the objective of the exercise was.
After that I noticed she's working more independently and grew interested in the
subject. She had a problem working with the mouse and after 2 days I've nudged
her to use the TrackPoint and mouse buttons on a ThinkPad laptop. She uses them
with both hands, so am I btw, and is much more adept at controlling the cursor
that way. If you are going to teach children how to work effectively with a computer
you may as well start with teaching them to work effectively with a track pad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courses are comprised of games and puzzles (which she's very good at)
asking children to perform a very basic programming concept. For example instruct
an angry bird to move left or right by using blocks for each instruction.
By the time the workshop was over Adriana had completed 4 levels on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 5 introduced a button for step-by-step execution of the program also
colloquially known as debugging :). The first few exercises she had no idea
what to do with this debugging button. Then the 6th exercise introduced a
wrong starting sequence and everything snapped into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 7 introduced additional instructions. There are move left/right instructions
as well as visit a flower and make honey instruction. This level also introduces
repeating instructions, for example make honey 2 times. At first that was confusing
but then she started to take a notice at the numbers shown on screen and started to
figure out how to build the proper sequence of blocks to complete the game.
When she made mistakes she used the debugging button to figure out which block
was not in place and remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this level Adi started making more mistakes, but more importantly she also
started trying to figure them out on her own. My help was limited to asking
questions like "what do you need to do", "where are you at the screen now",
"what instructions do you need to execute to get where you want to be".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 8 introduces a new type of game, drawing shapes on the screen. The hardest
part here is that you need to jump from one node to another sometimes. This
is great for improving the child spatial orientation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 11 is a reading game in English. You need to instruct a bee to fly across
different letters to complete a word shown on the screen. However Adriana can't
read much less in English, although she understands and speaks English
well for her age. In this case I believe she relied on pattern recognition
to complete all exercises in this level. She would look at the target word
and then identify the letters on the playing board. Next she would stack instruction
blocks to program the movements of the bee towards her goal as in previous exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 13 introduces loops. It took Adriana 7 exercises to figure out what a loop
is, identify the various elements of it and how to construct it properly.
She also said that was amusing to her. Almost immediately she was able to identify
the length of the loop by herself and construct loops with only 1 block inside
their body. Loops with 2 or more blocks inside their body were a bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 14 introduced nested loops, usually one or more instruction blocks paired
with a loop block, nested inside another loop block. For example:
&lt;code&gt;repeat 3 times(move left, repeat 2 times(move down))&lt;/code&gt;. Again it took her about 6
exercises to figure them out. This is roughly at the middle of the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 16 was quite hard. It had blocks with parameters where you have to type
in some words and animal characters will "speak these words" as if in a comic book.
I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a text to speech engine integrated for
this level but sounds like a good idea. Anyhow this level was not on-par with
her skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course completed with free range drawing using instruction blocks and cycles.
The image she drew was actually her name where she had to guess how much scribbles
the painter needs to do in one direction, then traverse back and go into another direction.
She also had to figure out how big each letter needs to be so that it is possible to
actually draw it given the game limitations in motion and directions. This final level
required lot of my help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never had any doubts that small children are very clever and
capable of understanding enormous amounts of information and new concepts.
However I'm amazed by how deep their understanding goes and how fast they
are able to apply the new things they learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through games and practical workshops I believe it is very easy to teach
children to gain valuable skills for engineering professions. Even if they
don't end up in engineering the ability to clearly define goals and instructions,
break down complex tasks into small chunks and clearly communicate intentions
is a great advantage. So is the ability to analyze the task on your own and
use simple building blocks to achieve larger objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to keep notes on Adi's progress but will very likely write
about it less frequently. If you do have small children around you please
introduce them to &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://studio.code.org/"&gt;studio.code.org&lt;/a&gt; and help them learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="fedora.qa"></category></entry></feed>
