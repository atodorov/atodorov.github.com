&lt;p&gt;The first
&lt;a href="http://www.2016.gemorg.bg/"&gt;GEM Conference in Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; took place on
Monday and Tuesday. I missed most of the sessions due to other meetings
and tasks but managed to attend a workshop on the topic
&lt;strong&gt;How to harness the power of influence and communication in entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;
by Plamen Popov and Yassar Markos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3 Fundamentals for Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Plamen and Yassar there are 3 key fundamentals for any kind of
communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willingness&lt;/strong&gt; to pay the price for this communication to happen;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; because we need to try different approaches until we
reach the desired person in a way they can understand what we're saying;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt; because we always need to be consistent in what we deliver
to others so that we always match their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 Communication Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are 4 basic communication styles based on how formal or informal
the communication is and how passive or aggressive it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director&lt;/strong&gt; aka dominant style - they exhibit formal and aggressive
communication. Key words for them are results, effectiveness, no small talk,
to the point. They dislike wasting their time because they always have something
better and more interesting to do. This is why people in this group are
the worst listeners. They love conflicts and seek ideas and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expresser&lt;/strong&gt; aka promoting style are dominant/aggressive but informal.
They are loud, always speak about
themselves, they want public attention and to be unique. They forget details but instead
are able to grasp the big picture quite easily. They have lots of energy and
passion and love to start new projects and don't complete them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonizer&lt;/strong&gt; aka supportive style - they exhibit informal and passive
communication. They love connections and relationships, they use soft
language and look after people and team mates. They don't like conflicts and
competitive games. People from this style get impressed when you share
personal stories and details with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinker&lt;/strong&gt; aka analytical style people are formal but non-aggressive. They
like to know all the facts and always ask lots of questions because they need
to understand the big picture. They need time to understand before they can make
a decision. In their lives everything has a particular place. They are prone to
postponing tasks until they reach perfection (which they never will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person typically has one dominant style and a mix of one or two others. I myself
am mostly Director and Expresser aka dominant and promoting with a pinch of Thinker.
I mostly lack the Harmonizer traits. However it is more important to know what
style the person you are talking to is, not what your personal style is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When judging the style of others take into account where you stand. A person who
is strongly formal and aggressive will view a less formal and mild person as the
Expresser or Harmonizer style. However to a 3rd party both of these two persons may
appear to be dominated by the Director style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make a Good Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presenting to a single person or a small group obviously you have to tailor
your presentation according to their communication styles. However when presenting
before a large and diverse crowd you need to account for all of them in the following
order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture the Expresser or promoting style by giving them a promise for something
cool and interesting. Because they easily forget details and become distracted you
can lose them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then capture the Director or dominant style by asserting your authority. State your
expertise in the field to establish trust. Also sell them the idea for efficiency
because this is the value they need to extract from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third comes the Harmonizer or supportive style. They seek open people to
connect with. Personal stories and struggles are the best way to engage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last comes the Thinker or analytical style. They need to know all the information
so you have to give them links and materials for further reading. It is also
a good idea to give them the ability to ask you questions later (via email, chat, etc)
because they will analyze your ideas and come up with more questions on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already started to organize my presentations based on the above 4 key points
so hopefully you will see me delivering better talks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Learned from IT Weekend</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-08T13:48:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-08:blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend.png" title="IT Weekend" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended the first &lt;a href="http://it-weekend.com"&gt;IT Weekend&lt;/a&gt; in Bulgaria.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. There were 20 people
attending and the format was very friendly and relaxed. The group had members with
various levels of experience and technical skills, also different areas they work in.
All presentations are on
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRA3tRwclRU&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.
Here's a brief of what happened and what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the honor to present in the first slot and gave a quick introduction
to mutation testing. This was my first time giving this talk and I'm not entirely
happy with how I've presented it. Also mutation testing is touching a lot on unit tests,
programming and source code which in some organizations goes to the devel department.
I think mutation testing is harder to understand from people not familiar with it
than I initially thought. I'm taking note to improve the way I present this topic
to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yavor Donev gave a good overview of Appium and how to use it on Android.
The most important question for me was "&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to utilize the same test suite
on Android and iOS, given that the environments are different&lt;/em&gt;". With this I mean
regardless of how much we try to make the same (native) app on both platforms
it will end up differently because the platforms are essentially different. For
example there is a different number of physical buttons available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that both iOS and Android apps follow the same design and use
similar workflow then it should be possible to create a test suite which is
platform aware and account for the minor differences. We're also adding
another layer of complexity by introducing the requirement that both apps stay
in sync with each other and account for the quirks of the foreign platform.
Depending on your apps and goals this may not be an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I didn't like about Appium is that upstream doesn't care much about
version compatibility and they tend to break and change stuff arbitrary between
releases. That said if it works, don't update it or otherwise be extremely
careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a nice chat with Yavor on the topic of career change, learning to
program and working with people who have very little coding experience. His
approach is to develop a higher level test framework on top of Appium which
his team mates can use more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aneta Petkova's &lt;em&gt;Selenium Grid in Unix Environment&lt;/em&gt; is a bit out of my domain.
However I took one important lesson: regardless of how great your tools are
there are minor details which can make or break your day. In her case these
are the physical location of the tests (e.g. which Selenium node runs them) and
access to shared resources. Turns out WebDriver doesn't give you
this information directly and you need to go through hoops to get it. Her
solution was to place the test code on the Grid Hub and provide a shared file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger lesson is: whenever you have to design an automated test environment
(aka test lab) make sure to evaluate your needs beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last talk was a guest appearance by Denitsa Evtimova. She is a QA architect
with 16 years of experience and presented the QA strategy at Paysafe group.
They have a large monolithic system (legacy code) and have adopted a pyramid
style approach to testing. Whenever possible tests are brought down to the lowest
level (e.g. unit tests) and not repeated on the higher levels. At the top
stand manual testing. Teams are small: 3-4 developers and 2-3 QAs. It is the team
responsibility to make sure tests are implemented at the lowest possible level.
The process is not strictly enforced and the company relies more on self
governance in this aspect. Also everyone on the team can contribute
additional tests whenever they see something missing.
Test (writing) tasks are all logged in JIRA. They are also small so that
everything can be completed in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was more informal. We did a quick exploratory testing
exercise and shared opinions on different test tools. Then the group had
a discussion about soft skills and how QA engineers can change the perception
of developers about the QA profession (especially in teams where there are many
manual testers). The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criticize the software, not the person, e.g. don't blame the person directly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate with concrete facts and data, not emotions and perceptions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes of the type "how many QA engineers are needed to screw a light bulb"
are a problem because they lead to underestimation of the job role;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it is not quite clear (to others) how the QA role contributes to
the development of the product and the organization;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a QA it is important to be able to give a non-biased opinion and
observations on what is happening with the product/process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A QA person needs to be very calm. They have to be able to listen to
everybody (especially developers) and accept their point of view but at
the same time also communicate their own point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important
to sit together with developers and observe the problem, brainstorm and
propose possible solutions. This also creates a feedback loop where the
developer feels empowered because he's part of the process identifying
the problem and proposing the best solution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In agile teams it is a good idea to rotate people between developer and
QA positions. This will help them better understand the job of others,
acquire new skills and also bring fresh thinking to the team;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance is an ungrateful job and only people with very calm and methodical
thinking (to follow through and write all possible scenarios) are able to excel
in this field. On the other hand developer usually think about the happy path
scenarios and strive to make their code work as best as they can;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By rotating job roles within the team developers
will quickly find out that testing is not their field and gain respect
towards their QA peers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US managers have the habit of telling "good job" to everyone, even for
small and routine tasks. In Bulgaria (and maybe elsewhere) we're not used
to this. Instead we're used of being scolded when we do something wrong.
If everything is good then we don't receive any recognition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the American "good job" is actually a good thing. Team mates will
start performing better over time because they will feel their work is
valued and not meaningless, they will feel recognized which will boost
morale and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Learned from EuRuKo 2016</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/26/what-i-learned-from-euruko-2016/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-09-26T01:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-09-26:blog/2016/09/26/what-i-learned-from-euruko-2016/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EuRuKo 2016" src="/images/euruko2016.jpg" title="EuRuKo 2016" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my frequent readers may know I try to summarize all the conferences
and events I go to. This year's EuRuKo inspired me to take a different
approach and instead of quickly summarizing the event I will try to
highlight what I have learned from it! My intention is to use this as a
tool to improve my skills and the work I do. It will probably be a long
post so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say that I don't consider myself a Ruby developer although I do
write a small amount of Ruby code. I also don't really consider myself a
developer although I have a formal degree in software engineering and do
my fair share of open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being different and thinking differently has always been helpful to me in
Quality Assurance and this time was no exception. Attending a conference
I knew nothing about and meeting with people whose job is totally different
than mine turned out to be my greatest experience on the conference circuit
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get out of the comfort zone, meet new
people, exchange ideas and learn!&lt;/strong&gt; The very fact that I am writing this post
not following my usual summary style proves this is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very early during the event I started to notice a recurring theme which grew
stronger by the minute. The Ruby community is very open and inclusive to newcomers
and they seem to be doing a very good job about on-boarding everyone who wants to
learn. I already wrote about Ivan Nemitchenko's
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/"&gt;experience of organizing remote internships&lt;/a&gt;
and there are also the Rails Girls local communities, the 
&lt;a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/"&gt;Rails Girls Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (didn't know about it)
and the various local Ruby communities who pitched their cities to host the next
EuRuKo. I really loved this feeling of community. In the broader Linux, Python and
QA world I have not seen this being so pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open up (the open source) community even more. Make it easier for newcomers to join!
Treat them as human and don't expect them to be like yourself. Do teach and mentor
both to help newcomers but also to help yourself become better!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly on par with my community work but I think I can do better. I will take
the time to evaluate what I've been doing in the past and identify areas for improvements.
I also encourage my readers and students to send me feedback as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned that junior developers can make meaningful
contributions to production grade code when they are given the appropriate set of tasks
and guidance. Stephanie Nemeth argued that companies should hire (more) enthusiastic
career changers as junior developers because they have very strong motivation for
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate how we look at junior developers, especially how we examine and hire them
and how we on-board them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lessons 2 and 3 are valid in the open source world and even more so in the
corporate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked the fact that some of the lightning talks were given by people who
had no previous experience in Ruby. @TeamJoda2016 talked about what they did and
learn throughout the summer and really cracked the room with their
"oh and btw we are looking for a job" as their final slide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are new/inexperienced at something don't be afraid to try it out. Give it
the best you've got and see how it goes. Worst case .... well nothing bad really happens,
best case you end up doing the best job in your life.&lt;/strong&gt; That's also been my
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/19/7-years-1400-bugs-red-hat-qa/"&gt;personal experience with software testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carina C. Zona's &lt;em&gt;Consequences Of An Insightful Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;
(old video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheE6udjfGI&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
dealt with the ethical
responsibilities of us as developers and this is becoming more common with deep learning neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re able to extract remarkably precise
intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn’t
consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krissy's &lt;em&gt;The HTT(Pancake) Request&lt;/em&gt; made a great analogy of consuming APIs with
your customer experience when visiting a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design APIs (software in general) as if that was a physical product where your
customers happiness matters&lt;/strong&gt;. We see this all the time in our daily jobs and we're
guilty of doing it as well. Btw at the moment I'm in the middle of huge refactoring
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit"&gt;django-chartit&lt;/a&gt; which breaks all
backwards compatibility. I guess I will have to re-evaluate my design and approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By accident I've made good friends with Alex Georgiev and the folks at Fyber.
I liked the fact that at the conference they had couple of people
working in QA and we managed to have a nice talk about QA vs developers and the transformation
between the two. That also touched on the bigger subject of testers not being able to
code and testers not being available for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving people to improve their skills (learn to code, write tests, etc) is possible
but needs to come from management, needs clear direction and also a little bit of peer pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all isn't that what an agile team is supposed to be ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now being the able to code, not entirely Ruby ignorant QA guy that I am I was
immediately offered several positions in London and Berlin (and no I'm still staying
in Sofia). As it turned out good QA engineers with good development skills are
in greater demand than developers not only in Sofia but all around the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellow QA guys, please do learn to program. Dear developers, please try thinking
more like a tester the next time you write code&lt;/strong&gt; (me included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring a barista and furnishing your company stand with the best coffee machine
you can afford while having an ugly hand written sign saying "MAIN CONFERENCE COFFEE -&amp;gt;"
is a marketing stunt that I really love. I'm not sure how well that worked for their
hiring but it got them visibility. I'm definitely stealing this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference coffee sucks. Provide better one and developers will queue at your stand.
To a greater extent - research your target and their needs and provide a product
that solves their problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we gave back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal contribution back was telling Yammer and Deliveroo about mutation
testing and pointing them to the right tools and videos on the subject. I wish
them good luck and happy testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I will be speaking about mutation testing at
several different events in Bulgaria in the next 2 months so make sure to find

EuRuKo yesterday
(slides &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/creatop/my-experiense-of-remote-internship-for-junior-ruby-developers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
I'm writing this because that was the best talk both
in terms of content and visual presentation I saw at the conference and because
it is closely related to my work with &lt;a href="http://hackbulgaria.com"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is that at some point Ivan was mentoring several junior developers
and saw the need to scale this effort so he did a call for interns and got back 60 replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What an Intern Gets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects in their portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working experience, including team work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing an entire product from idea to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan wanted to find suitable interns who have basic Ruby on Rails knowledge
and who could invest a minimum of 20 hours per week of their time so he devised
an aptitude test of 3 parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The three part test &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inem"&gt;@inem&lt;/a&gt; used to challenge 60 candidates for a Ruby internship. Pretty cool. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/euruko?src=hash"&gt;#euruko&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsnN03pXkf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsnN03pXkf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tatiana Stantonian (@binaryberry) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/binaryberry/status/779664766394564608"&gt;September 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 is developing basic functionality of the product.
Part 2 was adding different user types which require different validation logic, etc.
Part 3 was adding "purchasing" logic via external APIs. In Part 3 intentionally
there was no code review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was shit! That was the purpose of the test. The reasoning being that
there is no right or wrong way to solve the problems he presented to the interns. Instead
he wanted to make them think and decide on a solution. Then feel the pain of their decision.
Ivan argues that what made us senior developers are these pains we have experienced at some
point in our careers, those fuck-ups that we did in some old project. All of them made us
better in our job because we could learn from the mistakes we've made and more importantly
understand the consequence of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common mistakes Ivan saw were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring levels of abstraction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using too many gems without knowing or understanding their limitations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gems were treated as the only way to solve a problem. More importantly changing
this way was out of the question;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interns didn't know about &lt;a href="http://stevelorek.com/service-objects.html"&gt;service objects&lt;/a&gt;,
well even some experienced developers seem to not know that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business logic was all around the place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad naming all around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing Ivan did was a group hangout code review followed by a short lecture about
design patterns, a refactoring session and finally cross code review. At the end the
product was delivered as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following these initial efforts Ivan continued (with even more interns, or the next group of them I think)
by asking interns to develop internship automatization, that is a means for the system to
distribute tasks based on git commits, tags, etc so it can scale. They've added an admin
dashboard and started working on an open source alternative to NewRelic (if I got that correctly).
He was also able to enlist 2 more mentors to help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems Ivan found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough mentors and external projects to work on for all of the interns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating a project as not real (e.g. not a real world product) is a mistake;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A training project has the same management issues that a real product will have
and they need to be resolved in pretty much the same way;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was collective irresponsibility from the group of interns. They didn't do
what they said they will do;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were communication issues between the interns and the lack of enough mentors
was an obvious problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was also lack of motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say these are the typical problems one also sees in almost any teams. It doesn't
matter if these are teams of students or teams of developers inside some company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What a Junior Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A real project to work on;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A business context, a reason why something should be done and why it needs to be
done in a particular way&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some visible achievement for their portfolio;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team work experience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole cycle development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan thinks that &lt;strong&gt;the aptitude test worked great&lt;/strong&gt; because his interns were able to find
good jobs afterwards but he will change a few things. There will be even more tests
and he will reject unfit/bad interns. He will also do call for mentors not only for interns.
And he wants to turn mentors' experience into tests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the "business context" item. IMO even seasoned developers need to have this
if they are expected to create a great product for their company. We're not just coders but
sometimes companies forget that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also wondering how can I apply a similar aptitude test in my work (both mentoring at
HackBulgaria and otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How about Senior Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all have routine tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and research tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice to have features and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low priority features;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side project ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing features in their favorite open source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior developers' tasks and desires will have to align with what a junior needs in order
for the mentorship to work. As senior devs we often make a mistake and expect everyone else
to think the same way we do and act as fast as we do. &lt;strong&gt;Ideally senior developers want to have multiple clones
of ourselves to work with!&lt;/strong&gt; I myself have been guilty of that and trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of a for-profit company the above findings should be taken into deep consideration
if you are about to have interns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk I was lucky to talk to Ivan and tell him more about the training sessions
at HackBulgaria. I also proposed to him the sponsorship model which he hasn't considered.
He then made a counter offer: ask interns for high payment upfront and let them recoup that
based on their progress towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really happy to have heard this presentation and being able to talk to Ivan in person. I also have
my notes about my "QA and Automation 101" training at HackBulgaria and I now
have a better idea how to go about organizing and summarizing them (will try to publish that soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Ivan works at GitLab and promised to look at an issue I personally have
so here it is &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/7953"&gt;GitLab #7953&lt;/a&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/617994718381217/"&gt;Questers Beer'n'Code Day&lt;/a&gt;
which was an open air mini-conference held at the terrace of their office.
As to organization the only drawback was the summer sun which made it impossible
to see anything on the screen. Most speakers were OK with that although they
wanted to show some code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recorded all talks and they are available in my
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2ILL8Xq5s&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;TECH TALKS&lt;/a&gt;
YouTube play list. You can also hear me asking some questions from behind
the camera. All of the talks are in Bulgarian though, so sorry for my
English speaking readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon started with Lidiya Georgieva and her talk about clean code
and code smells. I find the topic particularly interesting but she didn't
go into more details. She said she had used SonarCube but couldn't recommend
any other tools, except for the standard lint style ones. I have been using
&lt;a href="https://landscape.io/github/MrSenko/pelican-ab/"&gt;LandScape.io&lt;/a&gt; for all
Python based code I've been working on recently and I think it is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talk I found interesting was by my fellow QA Petar Sabev on reporting
bugs. It was more of an entry level talk, but still very informative for both
less experienced QAs and other technical folks so I definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one, and most interesting, was Bogoi Bogdanov with Scaling Agile.
Despite the name
he covered some basics about Agile and what it actually is. Afterwards we've stayed
and talked for a good 2 hours more. I definitely would like to hear more from
him in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to Questers for hosting this event and allowing me to record it.

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I visited &lt;a href="http://tuxcon.mobi"&gt;TuxCon&lt;/a&gt; in Plovdiv and
was very happy to meet and talk to some of the creators of the Puldin
computer! On the picture above are (left to right) Dimitar Georgiev
- wrote the text editor, Ivo Nenov - BIOS, DOS and core OS developer,
Nedyalko Todorov - director of the vendor company and Orlin Shopov -
BIOS, DOS, compiler and core OS developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puldin is 100% pure Bulgarian development, while the “Pravetz” brand
was copy of Apple ][ (Pravetz 8A, 8C, 8M), Oric (Pravets 8D) and IBM-PC
(Pravetz 16). The Puldin computers were build from scratch both hardware
and software and were produced in Plovdiv in the late 80s and early 90s.
50000 pieces were made, at least 35000 of them have been exported to Russia
and paid for. A typical configuration in a Russian class room consisted of
several Puldin computers and a single Pravetz 16. According to Russian sources
the last usage of these computers was in 2003 serving as Linux terminals
and being maintained without any support from the vendor
(b/c it ceased to exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Puldin 601" src="/images/puldin601.jpg" title="Puldin 601" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main objectives of Puldin was full compatibility with IBM-PC.
At the time IBM had been releasing extensive documentation about how their
software and hardware works which has been used by Puldin's creators as
their software specs. Despite IBM-PC using faster CPU the Puldin 601 had
a comparable performance due to aggressive software and compiler optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing wise the guys used to compare Puldin's functionality with that of IBM-PC.
It was a hard requirement to have full compatibility on the file storage layer,
that means floppy disks written on Puldin had to be readable on IBM-PC and vice
versa. Same goes for programs compiled on Puldin - they had to execute on IBM-PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything of course had been tested manually and on top of that all the software
had to be burned to ROM before you can do anything with it. As you can imagine the
testing process had been quite slow and painful compared to today's standards.
I've asked the guys if they'd happened to find a bug in IBM-PC which wasn't present
in their code but they couldn't remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was interesting for me on the hardware side was the fact that you can plug
the computer directly to a cheap TV set and that it's been one of the first computers
which could operate on 12V DC, powered directly from a car battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pravetz 8" src="/images/pravetz16.jpg" title="Pravetz 8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a fully functional Pravetz 8 with an additional VGA port to
connect it to the LCD monitor as well as a SD card reader wired to function as a
floppy disk reader (the small black dot behind the joystick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who missed it (and understand Bulgarian) I have a

Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DEVit 2016" src="/images/devit2016.jpg" title="DEVit 2016" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://techministry.gr"&gt;TechMinistry&lt;/a&gt; is Thessaloniki's hacker space which
is hosted at a central location, near major shopping streets.
I've attended an
&lt;a href="http://discourse.techministry.gr/t/18-05-2016-19-30-open-source-wednesday/67"&gt;Open Source Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;
meeting. From the event description I thought that
there was going to be a discussion about getting involved with
Firefox. However that was not the case.
Once people started coming in they formed organic groups and
started discussing various topics on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also shown their 3D printer which IMO is the most precise of 3D printers
I've seen so far. Imagine what it would be like to click &lt;em&gt;Print&lt;/em&gt;, sometime
in the future, and have your online orders appear on your desk over night.
That would be quite cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've met with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bacharakis"&gt;Christos Bacharakis&lt;/a&gt;, a Mozilla
representative for Greece, who gave me some goodies for my students at HackBulgaria!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I spent the day merging pull requests for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme"&gt;MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme&lt;/a&gt;
and attended the DEVit Speakers dinner at
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/massaliathessaloniki/"&gt;Massalia&lt;/a&gt;.
Food and drinks were very good and I even found a new recipe for mushrooms with
ouzo, of which I think I had a bit too many :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also told that &lt;em&gt;"a full stack developer is a developer who can introduce
a bug to every layer of the software stack"&lt;/em&gt;. I can't agree more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DEVit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference day started with a huge delay due to long queues for registration.
The fist talk I attended, and the best one IMO was
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCGBgI1MNwE&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;Need It Robust? Make It Fragile!&lt;/a&gt;
by Yegor Bugayenko (watch the video). There he talked about two different approaches to writing
software: fail safe vs. fail fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that when software is designed to
fail fast bugs are discovered earlier in the development cycle/software lifetime
and thus are easier to fix, making the whole system more robust and more stable.
On the other hand when software is designed to hide failures and tries to
recover auto-magically the same problems remain hidden for longer and when they
are finally discovered they are harder to fix. This is mostly due to the fact that
the original error condition is hidden and manifested in a different way which
makes it harder to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegor made several examples, all of which are valid code, which he considers
bad practice. For example imagine we have a function that accepts a filename
as parameter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_file_fail_safe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# read the file, do something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bytes_read&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_file_fail_fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;File does not exist&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# read the file, do something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bytes_read&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first example &lt;code&gt;read_file_fail_safe&lt;/code&gt; returns -1 on error. The trouble is
whoever is calling this method may not check for errors thus corrupting the
flow of the program further down the line. You may also want to collect metrics and
update your database with the number of bytes processed - this will totally
skew your metrics. C programmers out there will quickly remember at least
one case when they didn't check the return code for errors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example &lt;code&gt;read_file_fail_fast&lt;/code&gt; will raise an exception the moment
it encounters a problem. It's not its fault that the file doesn't exist and
there's nothing it can do about it, nor is its job to do anything about it.
Raising an exception will surface back to the caller and they will be notified
about the problem, taking appropriate actions to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegor was also unhappy that many books teach fail safe and even IDEs (for Java)
generate fail safe boiler-plate code (need to check this)!
Indeed it is me who asks the first question
&lt;em&gt;Are there any tools to detect fail safe code patterns?&lt;/em&gt; and it turns out there aren't
(for the majority of cases that is). If you happen to know such a tool
please post a link in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit disappointed by the rest of the talks. They were all high-level
overviews IMO and didn't go deep technical. Last year was better. I also
wanted to attend the GitHub Patchwork workshop but looking at the agenda
it looked like this is for users who are starting with git and GitHub
(which I'm not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing session of the day was
&lt;em&gt;"Real time front-end alchemy, or: capturing, playing, altering and encoding
video and audio streams, without servers or plugins!"&lt;/em&gt; by Soledad Penades from
Mozilla. There she gave a demo about the latest and greatest in terms of
audio and video capturing, recording and mixing natively in the browser.
This is definitively very cool for apps in the audio/video space but I can
also imagine an application for us software testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on computational and memory requirements you should be able to
record everything the user does in their browser (while on your website)
and send it back home when they want to report an error or contact support.
Definitely better than screenshots and having to go back and forth until
the exact steps to reproduce are established.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fedora.planet"></category><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Bulgaria Web Summit 2016 Report &amp; Videos</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/23/bulgaria-web-summit-2016-report-videos/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-23T12:54:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-02-23:blog/2016/02/23/bulgaria-web-summit-2016-report-videos/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Musala Room" src="/images/bws16_zoltan.jpg" title="Musala room" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, this year I've been moderator at
&lt;a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/"&gt;Bulgaria Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; again.
Here is a quick report of the even as seen from the room I was at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning sessions were dominated by database topics including
MariaDB, RocksDB and MammothDB. The MariaDB talk was particularly strong
while the rest were with average attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we switched to DevOps and Docker and the room exploded.
There were people sitting on the ground and standing around the walls. There
was not enough oxygen for everyone in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recorded all of the talks from this room. Most are in English.
You can watch them at

Here is a quick report
of what I did, saw and liked during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 0 - Elixir &amp;amp; Erlang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday started with an unexpected shopping trip. The airline broke
my luggage and I had to buy a replacement. The irony is that just before taking off
I saw a guy with an
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P65P1W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006P65P1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atodorovorg-20&amp;linkId=4VNFFQEDPY5JXCLP"&gt;Osprey Meridian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B006P65P1W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;
and thought how cool that was. The next day I was running around Brussels to
find the exact same model! I also searched to buy the book
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140238301/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140238301&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atodorovorg-20&amp;linkId=3I6DMH5CC6ZGNX5A"&gt;Teach Your Child How to Think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0140238301" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;
by Edward De Bono but all 4 bookstores I checked were out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the luggage problem solved I headed to
&lt;a href="http://betacowork.com"&gt;BetaCowork&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/brussels2016/"&gt;Brussels Erlang Factory Lite&lt;/a&gt;
where I learned a bit about Erlang and Elixir. I also managed to squeeze a meeting
with &lt;a href="http://www.betacowork.com/profile/122/gilbert-west/"&gt;Gilbert West&lt;/a&gt; talking about
open source bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found particularly interesting the Elixir workshop and the talk
&lt;a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/brussels2016/pieterjan-montens"&gt;Erlang In The Wild: A Governmental Web Application&lt;/a&gt;
by Pieterjan Montens. Later I've managed to get a hold of him and talk some more
about his experiences working for the government. As I figured out later we
are likely to have mutual friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BetaCowork was hosting FOSDEM related events during the entire week.
There was a GNOME event and the Libre Office Italian team was there as well.
Next time definitely worth a longer visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night was reserved for a dinner with the Red Hat Eclipse team and
a fair amount of beer at Delirium afterwards where I've met my friend
&lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giannisk"&gt;Giannis Konstantinidis&lt;/a&gt;
and the new Fedora Ambassador for Albania -
&lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jonatoni"&gt;Jona Azizai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all pretty good Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1 - Testing and Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Testing and Automation" src="/images/fosdem/2014/testing_automation.jpg" title="Testing and Automation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM was hosting the
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/"&gt;Testing and automation devroom&lt;/a&gt;
again. I've spent the entire Saturday there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely the most interesting talk was
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/closed_source_interop/"&gt;Testing interoperability with closed-source software through scriptable diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;
which introduced &lt;a href="http://frida.re"&gt;Frida&lt;/a&gt;. Frida is a testing tool which injects
a JavaScript VM into your process and you can write scripts driving the
application automatically. It was designed as means to control closed source
software but can definitely be used for open source apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked to both Karl and Ole about Frida and my use-case for
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/01/14/controlling-interactive-terminal-programs/"&gt;testing interactive terminal programs&lt;/a&gt;.
That should be easy to do with Frida - just hook into the read and write
functions and write some JavaScript or Python to run the test.
Later we talked about how exactly Frida attaches to the running process
and what external dependencies are needed if I'm to inject Frida
into the Fedora installation environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Testing embedded systems&lt;/em&gt; Itamar Hassin talked about testing medical devices
and made a point about regulation, security and compliance. Basically you are not
allowed to ship non-application code on production system. However that code
is necessary instrumentation to allow external integration testing. I suspect most
developers and QA engineers will never have to deal with so strict
regulations but that is something to have in mind if you test software
in a heavily regulated industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing complex software in CI&lt;/em&gt; was essentially a presentation about &lt;em&gt;cwrap&lt;/em&gt; which
I've seen at
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/"&gt;FOSDEM 2014&lt;/a&gt;.
It touched the topic from a slightly different angle though. Tests in any open source
project should have the following properties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to execute without the need of a complex environment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable full CI during code review (dependent on previous property);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to create complete integration tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demo showed how you can execute Samba's test suite locally without
preparing a domain controller for example. This helps both devel and external
contributors. Now contrast this with how Red Hat QE will do the testing - 
they will create a bunch of virtual and bare metal machines, configure all
related services and then execute the same test scripts to verify that indeed
Samba works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw I've been thinking what if I patch &lt;em&gt;cwrap&lt;/em&gt; to overwrite read and write ?
That will also make it possible to test interactive console programs,
wouldn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenkins as Code&lt;/em&gt; by Marcin and Lukasz was a blast. I think there were
people standing alongside the walls. The guys shared their experience
with &lt;a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin"&gt;Jenkins Job DSL&lt;/a&gt;
plugin. The plugin is very flexible and powerful,
using Groovy as its programming language. The only drawback is that it is
sometimes too complex to use and requires a steep learning curve. Maybe
&lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/"&gt;Jenkins Job Builder&lt;/a&gt;
is better suited if you don't need all that flexibility
and complexity. I've met both of them afterwards and talked a bit more
about open source bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Saturday evening I've visited a panel discussion about
&lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/startupbusaccelerate-the-impact-of-open-source-software-on-the-tech-industry-tickets-20869395925"&gt;the impact of open source on the tech industry&lt;/a&gt;
at &lt;a href="http://co-station.com"&gt;Co.Station&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href="http://europe.startupbus.com"&gt;The Startup Bus&lt;/a&gt;.
There was beer, pizza, entrepreneur networking and talking about startups
and open source. Do I need to say more? I will post a separate blog post
about the interesting start-ups I've found so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2 - Ping-pong with BBC Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ping-pong" src="/images/bbc_ping_pong.jpg" title="ping-pong" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was my lazy day. I've attended a few talks but nothing too interesting.
I've managed to go around the project stands, 
&lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5085"&gt;filed a bug against FAS&lt;/a&gt;
and scored the highest ping-pong score for the day at the BBC Open Source stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBC has a long history of being involved with education in the UK and the
&lt;a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk"&gt;micro:bit&lt;/a&gt; is their latest project. I will love to
see this (or similar) delivered by the thousands here in Bulgaria so if you
think about sponsoring let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accidentally I met
&lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Msivak"&gt;Martin Sivak&lt;/a&gt; - a former
Anaconda developer whom I've worked with in the past. He is now at the
Virtualization Development team at Red Hat and we briefly talked about
the need for more oVirt testing. I have something in mind about this
which will be announced in the next 2 months so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>OpenFest 2015 Impressions</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/11/11/openfest-2015-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-11-11T15:16:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2015-11-11:blog/2015/11/11/openfest-2015-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I've attended &lt;a href="http://openfest.org"&gt;OpenFest&lt;/a&gt; in Sofia. I have
mixed feelings about this year's event. Although I was so tired that I slept
through the entire Monday I find some of the presentations not so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day I've tried to attend the talk about &lt;em&gt;The Yocto Project&lt;/em&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://anavi.org"&gt;Leon Anavi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://kolev.info"&gt;Radoslav Kolev&lt;/a&gt;.
The room was full and I couldn't get in so I watched some of it outside
using the live streaming. Next was &lt;em&gt;Building Universal Applications with Angular 2&lt;/em&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://blog.mgechev.com"&gt;Minko Gechev&lt;/a&gt; followed by
&lt;em&gt;Free And Open Source Software In European Public Administrations&lt;/em&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://hillenius.com/"&gt;Gijs Hillenius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall impression from these talks was good. They were interesting to me
and I liked the way they were presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I've spend a good hour and more talking to Gijs, catching up on
a long overdue email thread about FOSS usage in Bulgarian public administrations.
It's always nice to put a face on the email address :). The outcome of this
is that I'll have to forward him quite a lot of local contacts. Also my
previous article
&lt;a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/10-steps-migrate-your-closed-software-open-source"&gt;10 steps to migrate your closed software to open source&lt;/a&gt;
is now available at OSOR's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day Two&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day two I had quite a few people to talk to but managed to attend couple of
presentations. In the main room &lt;em&gt;First Lessons in Control Theory&lt;/em&gt; by
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hiro_asari"&gt;Hiro Asari&lt;/a&gt; and at the end
&lt;em&gt;Collaboration In Open Source - How Does It Really Work?&lt;/em&gt; by
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ottokekalainen"&gt;Otto Kekäläinen&lt;/a&gt;. I am quite disappointed
by both, the challenge level wasn't the one I've expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro's subject is interesting but IMO he merely scratched the surface.
The first half of the presentation was an introduction in the field
and as far as I could tell most of the people left in the room
didn't need it. The most interesting part was probably the last 5-10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Otto's presentation I had the expectation it would be interesting stories
and failures from working with the community. Instead it was an introduction
why and how open source communities work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said both presentations are suitable for inexperienced public, folks
who are new to open source or IT in general. For folks like me, who have
been working for 10 years in the open they weren't so interesting.
I'm not against entry-level presentations but at least they have to
be properly annotated as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other presentation I've attended on day two was &lt;em&gt;Education 3.0&lt;/em&gt; by
Ivan Gospodinov. This was a non-technical talk which conflicted with
the lightning talks and I've missed 
&lt;a href="/blog/2015/05/20/free-software-testing-books/"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. I liked this one
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the event was held at a new venue which was a pleasant change.
I've heard there were more people attending since previous years yet
it seemed there is less seating capacity at the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after-party however was very good and just before leaving something
amazing happened to me. A guy comes to me and asks if I'm atodorov.
Obviously I am. Then he says he's my co-worker Vladimir Ralev from Red Hat.
Mind you we've talked many times on IRC but not once seen in person.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Data Event Coming to Sofia</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/07/01/open-data-event-coming-to-sofia/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-01T11:58:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2015-07-01:blog/2015/07/01/open-data-event-coming-to-sofia/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/17565601186"&gt;Open Data and Intelligent Government&lt;/a&gt;
is the name of upcoming event organized by &lt;a href="http://sofiatech.bg/en/"&gt;Sofia Tech Park&lt;/a&gt;
on July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (preliminary) topics for this event are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government vision for opening data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation of national platform for open data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal aspects of open data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation of &lt;a href="http://opendata.government.bg/"&gt;Bulgarian open data portal&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe and open data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open, coordinated e-government for citizens and business;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What has already been done by municipalities in Bulgaria;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy of Sofia municipality for open data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upcoming open data programming contest organized by Sofia municipality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also be participating in this event by covering two topics I'm close to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurship and open data - sharing my limited experience with Difio
and processing open data; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical tips for successful open data hackathon - sharing my observations as
a mentor at &lt;a href="http://hackfmi.com"&gt;HackFMI&lt;/a&gt; and giving some recommendations which will
help the alleged open data contest make a difference not being just another dull event
organized by governmental agencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far other confirmed speakers are Rado from &lt;a href="http://hackbulgaria.com"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt;/
&lt;a href="http://hackfmi.com"&gt;HackFMI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.obshtestvo.bg/"&gt;Obshtestvo.bg&lt;/a&gt; which are
working in the field of open government and open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also in touch with the event organizers and helping a little bit with the program.
If you're interested in speaking please get in touch with me ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>DEVit Conf 2015 Impressions</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/05/22/devit-conf-2015-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-22T12:01:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2015-05-22:blog/2015/05/22/devit-conf-2015-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a busy week after &lt;a href="http://devitconf.org/"&gt;DEVit conf&lt;/a&gt; took place in
Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" src="/images/devit2015.jpg" title="Crack, Train, Fix, Release" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started the day with the session called "Crack, Train, Fix, Release" by 
Chris Heilmann. While it was very interesting for some unknown reason I
was expecting a talk more closely related to software testing. Unfortunately at the
same time in the other room was a talk called "Integration Testing from the Trenches"
by Nicolas Frankel which I missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end Chris answered the question "What to do about old versions of IE ?".
And the answer pretty much was "Don't try to support everything, leave them with
basic functionality so that users can achieve what they came for on your website.
Don't put nice buttons b/c IE 6 users are not used to nice things and they get confused."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember I had a similar question to Jeremy Keith at 
&lt;a href="/blog/2015/04/20/videos-from-bulgaria-web-summit-2015/"&gt;Bulgaria Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; last month
and the answer was similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Which one is Jeremy's favorite device/browser to develop for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Your approach is wrong and instead we should be thinking in terms of what features are 
essential or non-essential for our websites and develop around features
(if supported, if not supported) not around browsers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw I did ask Chris if he knows Jeremy and he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the coffee break there was "JavaScript ♥ Unicode" by Mathias Bynens which
I saw last year at &lt;a href="http://how.camp/"&gt;How Camp&lt;/a&gt; in Veliko Tarnovo so I just stopped by
to say hi and went to listen to 
"The future of responsive web design: web component queries" by Nikos Zinas.
As far as I understood Nikos is a local rock-star developer. I'm not much into web
development but the opportunity to create your own HTML components (tags) looks
very promising. I guess there will be more business coming for
&lt;a href="http://telerik.com"&gt;Telerik&lt;/a&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to listen to "Live Productive Coder" by Heinz Kabutz but that one started
in Greek so I switched the room for 
"iOS real time content modifications using websockets" by  Benny Weingarten-Gabbay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch I went straight for
"Introduction to Docker: What is it and why should I care?" by Ian Miell
which IMO was the most interesting talk of the day. It wasn't very technical but
managed to clear some of the mysticism around Docker and what it actually is.
I tried to grab a few minutes of Ian's time and we found topics of common interest
to talk about (&lt;a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/"&gt;Project Atomic&lt;/a&gt; anyone?) but later
failed to find him and continue the talk. I guess I'll have to follow online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Perry with "Your Web Stack Would Betray You In An Instant" made a great show.
The room was packed, I myself was actually standing the whole time. He described a series
of failures across the entire web development stack which gave developers hard times
patching and upgrading their services. The lesson: everything fails, be prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last talk I visited was "GitHub Automation" by Forbes Lindesay. It was more of an
inspirational talk, rather than technical one. GitHub provides cool API so why not use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DEVit team" src="/images/devit2015team.jpg" title="DEVit team" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I know this is the first year of DEVit. For a first timer the team did great!
I particularly liked the two coffee breaks before lunch and in the early afternoon and the
sponsors pitches in between the main talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All talks were recorded but I have no idea what's happening with the videos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will definitely make a point of visiting Thessaloniki more often and follow the local
IT and start-up scenes there. And tonight is Silicon Drinkabout which will be the official
after party of &lt;a href="http://digitalk.bg/"&gt;DigitalK&lt;/a&gt; in Sofia.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fedora.planet"></category><category term="Django"></category><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Summary of Evolve Digital</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/06/11/summary-of-evolve-digital/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-11T22:29:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2014-06-11:blog/2014/06/11/summary-of-evolve-digital/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" src="/images/evolve_digital.jpg" title="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I've visited an event organized by the 
&lt;a href="http://www.atlantic-club.org/index.php?en"&gt;Atlantic Club of Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; which
officially marked the launch of a digital national alliance in Bulgaria. This is
part of an initiative of the European Commission, called 
&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs"&gt;Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs&lt;/a&gt;,
which aims to address the lack of
sufficient amount and quality professionals in Europe working in the
field of Information and Communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part was few short keynotes, including one from deputy prime minister
and memorandum signing and group photo. In the keynotes (and afterwards)
the stress was on the lack of relevant ICT skills and the need of an estimated
1 million digital workers by 2020 in EU alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two sessions were panel discussions. The first one presenting the local 
chapter of the Digital Coalition in Bulgaria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of the coalition are to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help more people master more digital skills (not only as developers but also
proper usage of social media, how to create content, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enable more people to choose digital jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help local talents present themselves on the global scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it (is supposed to) works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initiate own ideas and propose them for implementation (to the ICT industry and broad public I guess)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stimulate learning through doing, learning by example using real use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help (and possibly sponsor) outside projects and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the various companies supporting the coalition pledged how they are going to
help. The most interesting news from this panel was the announcement of a new HP
data center in Sofia which will be used as a training lab with access available to
students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second panel was about education and how to bridge the gap! The interesting points were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ministry of Education and Science admits they have finally realized that our educational
system and programs are behind current tendencies and need concrete steps in order to boost
education and science research;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samsung will open their innovation lab at Sofia University to outside students as well;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to pay more attention to content and training of teachers because they also have
a skills gap while young children do not;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked what Prof. Petar Kenderov from the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics
at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences said - in the outside world children are constantly sharing
and communicating with each other while at school (also to some extent in universities) they
are expected to not communicate, not share and keep quiet. He emphasized the value of learning through
experimentation vs. learning through reading and writing, e.g. the current way things work
and the old way of teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was obvious was that otherwise competing companies (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
VMware) were working together to fix some of the problems mentioned. However I'm a bit skeptical
that large multi-national companies will be flexible enough to make a positive change.
I'd bet on the independent organizations like &lt;a href="https://hackbulgaria.com/"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and
Svetlin Nakov's &lt;a href="https://softuni.bg/"&gt;Software University&lt;/a&gt; or initiatives by local Bulgarian companies
like the already proven &lt;a href="http://academy.telerik.com/"&gt;Telerik Academy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the entire program of the event, for anyone interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EVOLVE DIGITAL”

The event was very big this year, with 4 halls and 600 visitors.
I was moderating the so called &lt;em&gt;JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; hall and will concentrate on
what happened there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" src="/images/bgws2014.jpg" title="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" /&gt;
This is what my hall looked like at around 10:00 and stayed pretty much the same
during the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers at hall Rhodopi were (in order of appearance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/delian"&gt;Delian Delchev&lt;/a&gt; talking about the JavaScript
revolution taking over the world and how this language has become the most
widely used programming language in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hkdobrev"&gt;Haralan Dobrev&lt;/a&gt; with some tips about development
workflows, git, continuous integration and unit testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga for Geeks during the lunch break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boyan Dzhumakov with topics about home automation and Internet of things, who
demonstrated his bed side lamp controlled via a light sensor and Arduino.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boyanov.org/"&gt;Neven Boyanov&lt;/a&gt; continuing on the hardware topics with
comparison of ATmel, Arduino and Raspberry Pi and showing more examples of
small programmable devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/attodorov"&gt;Angel Todorov&lt;/a&gt; from Infragistics with a very
interesting talk about JavaScript instrumentation for performance analysis.
A very cool presentation and you should definitely check out his
&lt;a href="https://github.com/attodorov/cheetah.js"&gt;cheetah.js&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KrasimirTsonev"&gt;Krasimir Tsonev&lt;/a&gt; with 
&lt;a href="http://absurdjs.com/"&gt;AbsurdJS&lt;/a&gt; - a JavaScript library with superpowers.
Teaser: Krasimir is also publishing a book caled
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/472723298053537792"&gt;Node.js Blueprints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/krokodilerian"&gt;Vasil Kolev&lt;/a&gt; with a talk about security
and web service design and how most of the web is doing it wrong :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is no video or audio recording available. If you find
some of the talks interesting and would like to get more info about it let
me know. I will ask the presenters to share their slides or give more details
where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if you've missed the Web Summit in Sofia. There will be another one
in the autumn, held at Veliko Tarnovo. For more info please subscribe to the

&lt;p&gt;Day #2 of DigitalK started with the presentation of Piotr Jas of BlaBla Car.
What I really liked about it (picture TBA) was one particular graph depicting
the various types of travel (time before travel vs. cost of travel) and
visualizing different industries (e.g. air travel) or competitor companies.
The image clearly exhibited a blank space which is the exact market segment
where BlaBla Car have positioned themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very practical and easy to use tool for entrepreneurs in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the rest of the keynotes I can outline two in particular:
Ivan Hernandez' &lt;em&gt;Disruptive Innovation and the future of Digital Transformation&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;The future of Tech and Communities&lt;/em&gt; by Tim Röhrich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked them because both were very inspirational although not telling you
something which you haven't heard before. They were basically reinforcing
the spirit of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the small hall there was a workshop called 
&lt;em&gt;How to turn a good idea into a successful start-up&lt;/em&gt; led by Daniela Neumann,
which didn't turn out to be what I expected. She was talking about the early
cycle of idea/customer validation and I don't remember any particular example
being shown. Frankly most of the people have heard about this before (myself included)
and were quite bored. Not many of them stayed till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening continued with the already traditional Silicon Drinkabout in Sofia
which hosted many of the conference attendees. I did a quick visit only
because I had to prepare myself for Bulgaria Web Summit on the next day!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Twilio meetup and DigitalK 2014 Day 1</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/05/29/twilio-meetup-and-digitalk-2014-day-1/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-29T22:31:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2014-05-29:blog/2014/05/29/twilio-meetup-and-digitalk-2014-day-1/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The conference season (this week) is officially open! So here's my report about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started by accident last evening with a
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/629009950539772/"&gt;warm-up event&lt;/a&gt;
sponsored by Twilio at betahaus Sofia. I had the pleasure to have a long chat
with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilaineurope"&gt;Lisa from Twilio&lt;/a&gt; over a few beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was Day #1 of &lt;a href="http://digitalk.bg/"&gt;DigitalK&lt;/a&gt; which is the leading SEE
technology event. I've also visited the event last year and must say that this
time it is bigger. The main hall was totally packed. The WiFi connectivity has been
improved since last year but still sucked. I had more success using my 3G instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of Day #1 was the mini Seedcamp session which presented
10 startups. In order of appearance they are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adtapsy.com/"&gt;AdTapsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitcoini.com/"&gt;Bitcoini.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ikollect.net/"&gt;iKollect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rocketads.co/"&gt;RocketAds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scalewhale.eu/"&gt;ScaleWhale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://angel.co/smartoken"&gt;Smartoken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stepsss.co/"&gt;Stepsss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.talkie_kids.talkie"&gt;Talkie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://viblast.com/"&gt;Viblast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiziva.com"&gt;Wiziva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viblast, Stepsss and Talkie were the 3 finalists who also presented at the main hall.
Needless to say the coolest one from technology point of view is Viblast, which is
a peer-to-peer video streaming platform, utilizing WebRTC. They were also strong at the
presentation and look very strong at the business level as well. I wish them good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepsss is essentially a shoe sole with sensors paired with smart-phone apps to
give runners more info and feedback. I like it because they are a hardware company
although there's lots of competition in this space. I'd like to beta test their product
and see what happens when I go dancing all night long :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talkie is an educational app for children which helps them learn new languages. I had the
pleasure to see it in action before the actual presentation. The design is very cool
and the app does seem usable and complete. However I don't see much of a technological
challenge here and I'm not sure how will they deal with the strong competition in the ed-tech
space. We'll have to wait and see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the rest ScaleWhale and Smartoken do seem interesting but I really failed to get how things
will be organized on the technology side. Both ideas are run by a single person team, which
is a recipe for disaster (judging from my own experience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is Day #2 of DigitalK and on Saturday I'm moderating one of the rooms at
&lt;a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/"&gt;Bulgaria Web Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Expect more reports soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>HackFMI 3.0 Post-mortem</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/04/30/hackfmi-post-mortem/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-30T00:03:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2014-04-30:blog/2014/04/30/hackfmi-post-mortem/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi_beer.jpg" alt="HackFMI" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth &lt;a href="http://hackfmi.com/hackfmi3-winners/"&gt;HackFMI&lt;/a&gt;,
now traditional, hackathon was held this weekend.
It is over and I still can't wrap my head around what happened during these 3 nights. Here's
bits of code, beer, energy drinks and fun as I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks goes to Lilly and Misha who were running around like
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL6e3co4Qqc"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; managing the day-to-day activities.
Kudos to the rest of the team as well because they've established HackFMI as a tradition
and people already ask when is going to be the next event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the topic was &lt;em&gt;Hack for charity&lt;/em&gt; and immediate goal of raising money for
a sick kid. Most of the teams got to work to meet these goals. Only a few had worked
on slightly different charity (broadly defined) ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite two apps were Blago-darenie and SMShelp although they were not
developed with Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blago-darenie.outernetnotes.com/"&gt;Blago-darenie&lt;/a&gt; is a simple WordPress
site listing donation campaigns. Instead of directly donating money one needs to
promise something (an action, an object, etc) and put a price tag on it. When the
promise is claimed the two parties donate the money to that particular campaign
and exchange the promised goods or services. I've promised to cook dinner
involving tasty meatballs from horse meat and serve one of my wine bottles to whoever
decides to donate 25 EUR. (disclaimer: I'm a good cook and love wine more than code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ganev.bg/project-8/"&gt;SMShelp&lt;/a&gt; is an aggregator of donation campaigns via SMS
which are very popular in the country but lack a central repository for all of them.
A simple web site, live Android app and wonderful design secured the team the first place!
BTW Team 8 was &lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/"&gt;Adrian and Vihren&lt;/a&gt;
who took part in all previous editions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad both organizers and teams had listened to some of my feedback but there are
still things to improve. The most obvious one was that a quick communication channel
to all the teams is needed. Facebook and email just didn't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have couple of quick ideas involving Django and Twilio's cloud services.
Let me take a few more days to get it clear before going any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;/me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself mentoring as much as I could helping folks with Django or just
with general ideal or concepts, serving cake provided by &lt;a href="http://www.chaosgroup.com"&gt;Chaos Group&lt;/a&gt;
and opening stacks of energy drinks, going door to door and letting teams know deployment and presentation
details for the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me a bit was that there were many new teams (some involving previous contestants)
who were very diverse in their technological background. This presented a challenge to
some of them as they had to use a technology which nobody on the team knew very well
and had to make a working app with that. One team even changed from Python to PHP in the
middle of day 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I was pretty much helping the HackFMI team with whatever I can,
checking on my favorite teams from time to time and giving access to cloud servers
left and right to people who needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I missed the Grand Finale due to unexpected hardware problems involving
big iron and 150 litters of loose water :(. See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="hackathon"></category><category term="hackfmi"></category><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>FOSDEM 2014 Report - Day #2 Testing and Automation</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-03T22:54:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2014-02-03:blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Testing and Automation" src="/images/fosdem/2014/testing_automation.jpg" title="Testing and Automation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSDEM was hosting the
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/"&gt;Testing and automation devroom&lt;/a&gt;
for the second year and this was the very reason I attended the conference. I managed to get in
early and stayed until 15:00 when I had to leave to catch my flight (which was late :(). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 3 talks given by Red Hat employees in the testing devroom which was a nice opportunity
to meet some of the folks I've been working on IRC with. Unfortunately I didn't meet anyone from
Fedora QA. Not sure if they were attending or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the talks were interesting so see the official schedule and video for more details. I will
highlight only the items I saw as particularly interesting or have not heard of before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ANSTE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANSTE - Advanced Network Service Testing Environment is a test infrastructure controller,
something like our own &lt;a href="http://beaker-project.org/"&gt;Beaker&lt;/a&gt; but designed to create complex
networking environments. I think it lacks many of the provisioning features built in Beaker
and integration with various hypervisors and bare-metal provisioning. What it seems to do better
(as far as I can tell from the talk) is to deploy virtual systems and create more complex network
configuration between them. Not something I will need in the near future but definitely worth
a look at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;cwrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cwrap is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a set of tools to create a fully isolated network environment to test client/server components on a single host.
It provides synthetic account information, hostname resolution and support for privilege separation.
The heart of cwrap consists of three libraries you can preload to any executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one was the coolest technology I've seen so far although I may not need to use it at all,
hmmm maybe testing DHCP fits the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It evolved from the Samba project and takes advantage of the order in which
libraries are searched when resolving functions. When you preload the project libraries
to any executable they will override standard libc functions for working with sockets,
user accounts and privilege escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socket_wrapper library redirects networking sockets through local UNIX sockets and
gives you the ability to test applications which need privileged ports with a local developer
account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nss_wrapper library provides artificial information for user and group accounts,
network name resolution using a hosts file and loading and testing of NSS modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uid_wrapper library allows uid switching as a normal user (e.g. fake root) and
supports user/group changing in the local thread using the syscalls (like glibc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these wrapper libraries are controlled via environment variables and definitely
makes testing of daemons and networking applications easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one was just scratching the surface of an entire branch of testing which I've not
even considered before. The talk also explains why it is hard to test documentation and
what possible solutions there are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write user guides and technical articles which need to
stay current with the software this is definitely the place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation in the Foreman Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem//2014/previews/fosdem/fosdem_2014/dv/UD2218A/2014-02-02/12_51_36.ogv"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;
I've listened to. Definitely the best one from a general testing approach
point of view. Greg talked about starting with Foreman unit tests, then testing the merged PR,
then integration tests, then moving on to test the package build and then the resulting packages themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys try to even test their own infrastructure (infra as code) and the test suites
they use to test everything else. It's all about automation and the level of confidence
you have in the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the fact that no single testing approach can make you confident enough before shipping
the code and that they've taken into account changes which get introduced at various places
(e.g. 3rd party package upgrades, distro specific issues, infrastructure changes and such) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to attend only one session it would have been this one. There are many things for me
to take back home and apply to my work on Fedora and RHEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find any of these topics remotely interesting I advise you to wait until FOSDEM video
team uploads the recordings and watch the entire session stream. I'm definitely missing a lot
of stuff which can't be easily reproduced in text form.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's my report of what I saw and found interesting at this year's
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; which was held the last weekend in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening I've tried to attend the FOSDEM beer event at Delirium Cafe but
had a bad luck. At 21:30 the place was already packed with people. I managed to get
access to only one of the rooms but it looked like the wrong one :(. I think the space
is definitely small for all who are willing to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Saturday morning I did a quick sight-seeing most notably 
&lt;a href="www.migsworldwines.be/"&gt;Mig's wine shop&lt;/a&gt; and the area around it since I've never
been to this part of the city before. Then I took off to FOSDEM arriving at noon
(IOW not too late).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent most of my day at building K where project stands were and I stayed quite
a long time around the Python and Perl stands meeting new people and talking to them
about their upgrade practices and how they manage package dependencies
(aka promoting &lt;a href="http://www.dif.io"&gt;Difio&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fedora Octopus" src="/images/fosdem/2014/fedora_octopus.jpg" title="Fedora Octopus" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora stand was busy with 3D printing this year. I've seen 3D printing
before but here I was amazed of the fine-grained quality of the pieces produced.
This is definitely something to have in mind if you are building physical products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat's presence was very strong this year. In addition to the numerous talks they
gave there were also oVirt and OpenShift Origin stands which were packed with people.
I couldn't even get close to say hi or take a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/fosdem/2014/doudou_linux.png" alt="DoudouLinux" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day I went to listen to some of the lightning talks. The ones that
I liked the most were MATE Desktop and DoudouLinux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about MATE which I liked
is that they have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-university"&gt;MATE University&lt;/a&gt;
initiative which is targeting developers who want to learn how to develop MATE extensions.
This is pretty cool with respect to community and developers on-boarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doudoulinux.org"&gt;DoudouLinux&lt;/a&gt; is a Debian based distribution targeted at
small children (2 or 3 years old) based on simple desktop and educational activities.
I've met project leader and founder Jean-Michel Philippe who gave the talk. We chatted for
a while when Alejandro Simon from &lt;a href="http://www.kano.me/"&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt; came around and showed us a prototype
of their computer for children. I will definitely give DoudouLinux a try and maybe pre-order Kano as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening there was a Python beer event at Delirium and after that dinner at
Chez Leon where I had snails and rabbit with cherries in cherry beer sauce.
I've had a few beers with Marc-Andre from &lt;a href="http://egenix.com"&gt;eGenix&lt;/a&gt;
and Charlie from &lt;a href="http://www.clark-consulting.eu/"&gt;Clark Consulting&lt;/a&gt; and the talk
was mostly about non-technical stuff which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that we went back to Delirium and
re-united with &lt;a href="http://akurtakov.blogspot.com"&gt;Alexander Kurtakov&lt;/a&gt; and other folks from
Red Hat for more cherry beer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/"&gt;During the previous edition&lt;/a&gt; of the hackathon
I gave one team a special personal gift based on my estimation of their hacker level!
Thanks to &lt;a href="http://blog.ganev.bg"&gt;Vihren Ganev&lt;/a&gt; (one of the gift winners) for reminding
me about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I have even bigger items to give to those who think out of the box, who hack
their way around and are brave enough to try and change the world through software!
I have one 
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWCS52/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AWCS52&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atodorovorg-20"&gt;Lenovo Thinkpad Business Backpack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001AWCS52" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;
and one 
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TX7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004TX7H&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atodorovorg-20"&gt;Lowepro D-Res 20 AW Digital Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004TX7H" width="1" height="1" border="0"  style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;
(a bit bigger than the one on Amazon, easily fits a BlackBerry Z10) as seen on the pictures below.
Plus some small Red Hat branded items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lenovo bagpack" src="/images/hackfmi/lenovo_bagpack.jpg" title="Lenovo bagpack" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Lowepro case" src="/images/hackfmi/lowepro_case.jpg" title="Lowepro case" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Get The Gifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no rules, I will make a decision as I go along.
I can give away all items or none. It's up to you! Surprise me! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will be mentoring the teams who decided to work with Django but
I'm happy to talk to anyone who needs help or just wants to grab the
cool stuff! See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="hackathon"></category><category term="hackfmi"></category></entry></feed>
