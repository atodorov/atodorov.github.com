    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you happen to be on holiday in Bulgaria but would still like to meet
some hackers there are three events this month that I find interesting:
Plovdiv Conf, BlackBerry Mini Developer Jam and Varna Conf.</p>

<h2>Plovdiv Conf</h2>

<p><a href="http://plovdivconf.com/">Plovdiv Conf</a> will be held at the Plovdiv Fair
on July 6th 2013. There isn't an official program but the speaker profiles are
interesting. Among them are guys well known for their Ruby and Linux skills.</p>

<p>From the given list I recognize only half the names. One speaker that sounds
interesting to me claims experience with programming assembler for the mainframe.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://akurtakov.blogspot.com/">Alexander Kurtakov</a> from Red Hat/Eclipse
will be there as well so I'm planning to attend this event.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia</h2>

<p>Organized by BlackBerry Developer Group Balkan the
<a href="http://bb10jamsofia2013.eventbrite.com/">BlackBerry 10 Mini Jam Sofia</a> will be held
on July 11th 2013 at <a href="http://betahaus.bg">betahaus Sofia</a>. Last time I visited
a <a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">BlackBerry developers session</a> it
was very interesting.</p>

<p>My personal interest at the moment is not developing mobile applications but I'd like to hear
more about the possibilities. My understanding is that BlackBerry 10 is much more flexible
as a development platform compared to Android and iOS.</p>

<p>I will definitely attend this event because there will be a shiny new <strong>BlackBerry Z 10</strong>
waiting for me there :). I will tell you how to secure one after I get it.</p>

<h2>Varna Conf</h2>

<p><a href="http://varnaconf.com/">Varna Conf</a> is organized by the same people who do Plovdiv Conf.
It will be held on July 20th 2013 at Cherno More hotel in Varna.</p>

<p>Most of the speakers I don't know but there are couple of topics about testing and refactoring
which look interesting. However I will be more likely to socialize with the local development
groups rather than listening to all talks.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I will attend though. My initial plan was to attend but there are other personal
errands that are popping up. Given that it is not near Sofia I will probably skip it.</p>

<p>If you happen
to be on holiday at the Bulgarian sea side however, you should definitely check it out. And Varna is
a very nice city too.</p>

<p>Let me know if there are other interesting events in the vicinity! Use the comments and tell me where
are you going this month.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-23T13:29:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/bkvf_sofia.png" alt="BkVF Sofia" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/></p>

<p><a href="http://www.balkanventureforum.org/">Balkan Venture Forum</a> in Sofia is over. It's been two
very exciting days, full of many interesting talks both on stage and off stage.</p>

<p>There were so many things that happened and so many new people I met that it will be hard
to mention all of that in a single blog post. I just want to highlight the things I enjoyed
the most.</p>

<br /><br />


<h2>Networking &amp; pitching at the bar</h2>

<p>I've been invited to BkVF long ago. However my initial intention was not to attend because
this month proved to be very busy. I've changed my mind after Boyan Benev, one of the organizers
invited me 10 days ago with an interesting proposal - distribute <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>'s beer mats at the bar!</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/difio_beermats.jpg" alt="Difio beer mats" style="float:left;clear:both;display:inline-block;"/></p>

<p>So I was there for the networking. As I used to say when people asked me if I was pitching</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I am pitching at the bar!</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Networking was very intensive both during the coffee breaks and cocktail and during the sessions.
I've now got close to 50 new business cards in my pocket. I've met very cool guys and gals both
developers and non-tech.</p>

<p>From the companies that were pitching in the main hall I particularly liked
<a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a>, <a href="http://transmetrics.eu/">Transmetrics</a> and <a href="http://kimola.com/">Kimola</a>.
Imagga was probably the most deep-tech/science oriented company at BkVF while Transmetrics
and Kimola focus on cloud and big data solutions.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry development session</h2>

<p>OK, I'm not into mobile technology nor smart phones but that may change soon.
BlackBerry had a strong presence and I was able to talk to some of their developer
support folks.
The OS of BlackBerry 10 is based on QNX kernel with multiple SDKs available to write apps.
Most of all I like the fact that it is POSIX compliant with C/C++ native SDK available.
Qt/QML is also available.</p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in how hard it will be to port
some existing open source tools to BlackBerry. I'm talking Bash, Python and the
command line tools I currently use on Linux. I'll be contacting them in the near future
to get a device for testing and hacking and will keep you posted.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[HackFMI Post-mortem]]></title>
    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-15T10:27:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/hackfmi/hackfmi_beer.jpg" alt="HackFMI" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p>The first <a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI</a> event is now over :(. It was HUGE!
Kudos to the organizers, sponsors, mentors and all teams who took part and worked hard during
the weekend.</p>

<p>More than 100 people participated. There were 22 different teams presenting at the
finale yesterday evening. That in my opinion counts as a BIG success. I was surprised
to see so many people, lots of them first and second year at the university. There were
a good number of female hackers too, which I also didn't expect.
<em>DISCLAIMER: I've graduated a different university where the culture and male/female ratio
was different so my expectations were biased.</em></p>

<p>People had interesting ideas and were passionate about them. They set off hacking
on a big scale. At times they wanted to create too big of an application and had to
cut off some features due to time constraints.</p>

<p>Congrats to all of them and hopefully they continue hacking!</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>I wasn't able to talk to all the teams nor stay at the event full time but here is
how I saw things.</p>

<p>Organization was perfect. The best organized non-commercial local event I've seen in years.
There was food, beverages, T-shirts, even beer :). There were six big IT companies
<a href="http://hackfmi.com/sponsors-and-partners/">sponsoring</a> the
event. All of these are successful Bulgarian born companies.
Let that serve as an example!</p>

<p>The faculty was supporting the event too.
There were API and SQL dump for the teams to use. The entire building was open
during the weekend and during the night. Teams were able to make use of many rooms.
From what I know some of the successful ideas will be implemented into the faculty
administration as well. All of this is a first time and quite unexpected for a
Bulgarian university. I smell the wind of change already.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>My technology view of the event is limited to the teams I've mentored explicitly and the ones
I happened to walk by and interfere with. Naturally I gravitated around 4 teams using
Django and found two teams using PHP.</p>

<p>Django guys were doing well despite one of the teams not having any experience with it.
Most of the applications were such that didn't require extensive knowledge of Django internals
but require mere programming of all features they wanted to implement.</p>

<p>What stroked me is that folks were making their database models too complicated.
I stumbled across two use cases in different teams where they wanted to have
one to many or many to many relationships. I strongly advised against this.
Hopefully they will remember.</p>

<p>Django makes schema design a child's play and probably this is why lots of people
abuse and misuse that. My advise is keep the database as simple as possible
and move everything up the application layer. It's easier to change and to maintain
that way. Not to mention experienced DBAs are hard to find.</p>

<p><strong>Keep the DB simple and know your tools well! </strong></p>

<p>With PHP the case was pretty much the same. Guys had some extra fields in their DB schema
which were unnecessary. They also wanted to abuse the data types of the DB and not use native types.</p>

<p>All of these technological misunderstandings are coming from inexperience, I know.
To get a closer look at why it is important to have a simple schema look at:
<a href="http://ontwik.com/python/disqus-scaling-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-django-application/">Disqus: Scaling the World’s Largest Django Application</a></p>

<h2>The Hackers</h2>

<p>During one of the breaks I was outside and one of the mentors complained that
ideas were pretty much standard. No screen scraping for additional information,
no mashing up, no revolutionary ideas. Everybody was using the provided API and
SQL dumps. Well almost.</p>

<p>One of my favorite <a href="https://github.com/vcrazy/project-6">teams</a> set off to
write a PHP robot which will automatically login and extract information from
SUSI (the faculty information system). Unfortunately that didn't work so they
had to abandon it. They didn't known <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>
and there was not enough time to
try and hack some browser side extension which will do the trick but they promised
to try it.</p>

<p>Because of their unorthodox approach from the start they became my personal favorites
and received Red Hat swag from me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi2013_team_six_rh_swag.jpg" title="Team Six" alt="Team Six" />
Adrian and Vihren are Team Six!</p>

<h2>What I didn't like</h2>

<p>I didn't like the fact that there was lots of duplicate work and ideas. Only one team
built a mobile application based on API and services provided by another team.</p>

<p>I suggest there's a #hackfmi IRC channel next time so that people can communicate
with each other and focus on building great apps not reinventing the wheel.
<strong>Use IRC, you are hackers!</strong></p>

<p>What I was missing is that nobody proposed a pure cloud or big data application.
I don't know if there was enough data provided by the faculty for such kind of
ideas, probably there wasn't. Maybe next time there will be.</p>

<h2>Ohloh Stats</h2>

<p>While not participating actively except for a few hours of mentoring I found a
way to contribute. Many of the projects repositories are listed under
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013">https://www.ohloh.net/p/hackfmi2013</a> which provides some interesting insight
and stats.</p>

<p>The list is incomplete. Lots of teams didn't have any GitHub repos
or didn't push the code recently. I will be contacting all of them in the next few days
and hopefully we will have a more accurate statistics by the end of the week.
Expect a separate blog post about it.</p>

<p>If you missed this event you should be sorry. <a href="/blog/2013/03/24/upcoming-hackatons-in-sofia/">You were warned</a>!
If you attended please share your experience with me. What you liked, what you didn't.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackatons</a>
have been organized in Sofia and generally through Bulgaria for the
past several years but as far as I know they were mostly underground events.
There are two upcoming events which are somewhat different.</p>

<h2>"Record Voting" Hackaton</h2>

<p><img src="/images/opengov.jpg" alt="hackaton logo" /></p>

<p>Organized by <a href="http://iped.bg/en">INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT</a>
this hackaton is the first I know of, which will focus on government provided data.
The objective is to process data
(<a href="http://results.cik.bg/el2011_t1.zip">sample</a>) from the 2011 elections
and find persons who were able to vote in the last minute, between 20:00-21:00 hours thus
changing the election results by 20% in their voting section.</p>

<p>The event starts at 09:29 on 30th Mar 2013 @ <a href="http://www.betahaus.bg">betahaus Sofia</a>.
More info in Bulgarian <a href="http://bogomil.info/4805">here</a> and
<a href="http://iped.bg/bg/news-read/news1c">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'd love to attend but will be visiting a conference about mobile devices in
another town at the same time :(. If you do attend, let me know how fun it was.</p>

<p>Dare to read more on the topic about open government? I recommend starting with
<em>Open Government: Collaboration, Transparency, and Participation in Practice by
Daniel Lathrop and Laurel Ruma</em> (
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596804350/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596804350&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596804350" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
|
<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7040110-11260198?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.oreilly.com%2Fproduct%2F9780596804367.do%3Fcmp%3Daf-none-book-product_cj_9780596804350_%25zp&cjsku=9780596804367" target="_top">O'Reilly</a><img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/image-7040110-11260198" width="0" height="0" border="0" style="display:none; margin:0;padding:0"/>
). This is an excellent book with tons of examples and easy to read.</p>

<h2>HackFMI</h2>

<p><img src="/images/hackfmi/cropped-hackfmi.png" title="HackFMI" alt="HackFMI" /></p>

<p>FMI stands for <em>Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the Sofia University</em>
(not where I graduated). It's one of the
best, arguably the best, places to study for an IT career. Like most other universities in Bulgaria
its administration and processes suck big time!</p>

<p><a href="http://hackfmi.com/">HackFMI</a> is the first ever hackaton which will focus on students
improving faculty/university systems and processes. This is HUGE! As far as I know it is also the first
hackaton which is supported by academia.</p>

<p>I have already <a href="https://github.com/Hackfmi/Organization-Details/pull/2">volunteered</a> to be
a mentor at HackFMI. I am looking forward to this. It will be fun. See you there!</p>
