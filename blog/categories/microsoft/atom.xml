<p><a href="http://retidoc.com/">RETiDoc</a> automates personal ID data entry, speeding up
customer service and eliminating costly errors. The product is based on OCR
algorithms and could be used on hardware devices scanning the ID card or
through a compact scanner box specially designed for the need. The main problem
tackled by RETiDoc is manual data entry at service providers,
which is a time consuming, low-customer satisfaction process, filled with
expensive typos and low productivity at provider’s front offices.</p>

<p>Co-founder Martin Kulov takes us behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and <a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/">Team Foundation Service</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don't have the time to fill-in the details.</p>

<p>Hopefully they will do so in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/startup/deed.jpg" alt="Deed" style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ideedit.com/">Deed</a> is an action-provoking platform for challenging
yourself and others and also a business solution for improved engagement by the
corresponding communities. It solves the problem of passivity by converting people
who “Like” to people who “Act. The challenge format gives businesses an effective,
fresh and low-cost solution to maintain active connection with their communities
and measure engagement.</p>

<p>Emil Stoychev explains their technical background.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Deed is built around Microsoft technologies plus some open source libraries.</p>

<p>Their web application and API is built with ASP.NET MVC 3 using MS SQL 2008 database engine.
Deed is hosted on a single cloud server at Rackspace and uses Akamai CDN for static files
distribution. At the moment the team is testing Windows Azure cloud platform and plans
migrating there.</p>

<p>A native Windows Phone application also exists.</p>

<p>Lots of JavaScript and CSS frameworks come to play at the  web interface layer like
jQuery, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> for templates and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a>.</p>

<p>IDE of choice is Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for C# and Vim for everything else.
Source code revision control is managed with Mercurial and build scripts are written in Python.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>The Deed team had experience with Microsoft technologies initially so it was natural<br/>for us to choose this stack. While not perfect and costly in terms of hosting fees,<br/>it serves its purpose for the moment. When you start a new project and you want to get<br/>up and running fast your best choice is to use what you already mastered.<br/>That in our case was the Microsoft stack.</p><footer><strong>Emil Stoychev</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Indeed I strongly support this! Always use technologies you are a master at and change and
adapt along the way if necessary.</p>
