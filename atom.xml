testing CSS animations (
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxzzfFBR8o&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=6"&gt;video in Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;
). The software under test was an ad tech SDK which
provides CSS based animations to mobile apps and games. The content
is displayed inside a webview and they had to make sure animations were
working correctly on different OS and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the content (aka getting to know the domain) they figured out
in reality there were about 20 basic movements and transformations. So the
problem was reduced to "How do we test these 20 basic movements under
various OSes and devices" or "How do we verify that basic CSS transformations
are supported under different versions and flavors of the OS"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their test bed included hand crafted web pages with each basic movement
and then several ones with more complex animations (aka integration testing).
The idea was to load
these pages under different devices and inspect whether or not the animations
were visualized properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test script (aka their testing framework) was constantly recording the
coordinates of the elements under test to verify that they were really animated.
The idea was to use a sample rate of 20ms and expect at lest 20 different changes
to the element under test. Coordinates along with color and gradient were recorded
and then returned back and analyzed to report a PASS or FAIL result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simplistic framework has limitations of course. It is not currently checking
the boundaries of where the elements are rendered on the screen. Thus if everything
else works as expected this will be a false positive result. On their slides
this can be seen at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MIxzzfFBR8o?t=23m10s"&gt;23:10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note the entire effort took about 2 days, including research and preparing
the test content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the back to basics approach here and the simplistic framework that
MentorMate came up with. Sure it misses some problems but for that particular case
it is good enough, easy and fast to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>The Passionate Doer</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/21/the-passionate-doer/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-21T00:18:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-21:blog/2016/10/21/the-passionate-doer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Passionate violinist" src="/images/passionate.jpg" title="Passionate violinist" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I visited &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/factorystartup/"&gt;Startup Factory Ruse&lt;/a&gt;
and had the opportunity to attend
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1148556138570764/"&gt;The Passionate Doer – Lessons Learned&lt;/a&gt;
where Yana Petrova shared her journey with &lt;a href="http://cokitchen.bg"&gt;CoKitchen&lt;/a&gt;
in the past 2 years.
The event name comes from &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2eyyRkx"&gt;The Passionate Programmer&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doer is somebody who acts and strives to make changes. When you jump into something new
it looks hard and scary at first. With time the important and difficult tasks
begin to look like ordinary ones because you gain the experience required for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are a start-up company you have a limited amount of time and finance to
make a break through. Thus it is important to hire the right people, but Yana argues
it is more important to quickly dismiss the people who don't fit into your
organization. I quite agree with her and the following paragraphs are centered
around this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point Yana makes is about negative reactions and lack of motivation
in employees.
When a person is lacking motivation they have troubles making logical
connections between various tasks and are not able to see the big picture
or how their actions or lack thereof affect everything else in the
organization.
She thinks these are most likely due to problems in our private
lives instead of problems at work and as managers we should seek to understand
what triggers these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana believes fatigue makes us vulnerable to negative thoughts so it is best
to make important decisions after you've had a good rest. In similar fashion
her way to deal with a non-motivated employee is to give them a short break.
Then she asks whether or not the employee is
ready to return back to work and invest 100% into the job. If not then
both parties say good bye to each other. Yana also says that for most
problematic employees she'd seen it hasn't been worth it to bring them back
and try to improve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked Yana if she had some sort of test to keep track of how well
a person performs their job. She didn't quite answer but an indicator
for under-performance to her is how busy the rest of the team is. Unwillingness
to take corrective action, e.g. explore new ways of doing things, acquire
more skills or read particular books which will help improve on areas
she'd identified, is also a good indicator that the person will have a
tendency to under-perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana says she wouldn't keep an employee who defines their own boundaries
and doesn't want to expand them because that person will not go out of their
comfort zone. This leaves everyone else tiptoeing around that employee
and having to do the job they can't, which puts more stress on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same approach we should adopt towards customers as well. Get rid of rude and
angry customers so that the work flows with less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana has been part of many volunteer efforts and her mistake was that she
expected everyone to have the same volunteering spirit that she has. In reality
it turned out people had trouble managing their own time or lacking the
proper communication skills. Not taking responsibility for your actions and
not learning from mistakes are other traits she noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CoKitchen they aim at pairing completely different people with one another
so that everyone is able to learn the most from the other person. This is
part of their internal mentorship program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting book mentioned by a member of the audience was
&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2drohhT"&gt;Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us&lt;/a&gt;.
The book reveals the three elements of true motivation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AUTONOMY - the desire to direct our own lives;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MASTERY - the urge to get better and better at something that matters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PURPOSE - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an interesting book (from the point of view of the employer)
which is definitely going into my reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry if my notes are a bit terse this time, it's been a busy month.
I still hope you learned something new from this post. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first
&lt;a href="http://www.2016.gemorg.bg/"&gt;GEM Conference in Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; took place on
Monday and Tuesday. I missed most of the sessions due to other meetings
and tasks but managed to attend a workshop on the topic
&lt;strong&gt;How to harness the power of influence and communication in entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;
by Plamen Popov and Yassar Markos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3 Fundamentals for Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Plamen and Yassar there are 3 key fundamentals for any kind of
communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willingness&lt;/strong&gt; to pay the price for this communication to happen;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; because we need to try different approaches until we
reach the desired person in a way they can understand what we're saying;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt; because we always need to be consistent in what we deliver
to others so that we always match their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 Communication Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are 4 basic communication styles based on how formal or informal
the communication is and how passive or aggressive it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director&lt;/strong&gt; aka dominant style - they exhibit formal and aggressive
communication. Key words for them are results, effectiveness, no small talk,
to the point. They dislike wasting their time because they always have something
better and more interesting to do. This is why people in this group are
the worst listeners. They love conflicts and seek ideas and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expresser&lt;/strong&gt; aka promoting style are dominant/aggressive but informal.
They are loud, always speak about
themselves, they want public attention and to be unique. They forget details but instead
are able to grasp the big picture quite easily. They have lots of energy and
passion and love to start new projects and don't complete them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonizer&lt;/strong&gt; aka supportive style - they exhibit informal and passive
communication. They love connections and relationships, they use soft
language and look after people and team mates. They don't like conflicts and
competitive games. People from this style get impressed when you share
personal stories and details with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinker&lt;/strong&gt; aka analytical style people are formal but non-aggressive. They
like to know all the facts and always ask lots of questions because they need
to understand the big picture. They need time to understand before they can make
a decision. In their lives everything has a particular place. They are prone to
postponing tasks until they reach perfection (which they never will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person typically has one dominant style and a mix of one or two others. I myself
am mostly Director and Expresser aka dominant and promoting with a pinch of Thinker.
I mostly lack the Harmonizer traits. However it is more important to know what
style the person you are talking to is, not what your personal style is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When judging the style of others take into account where you stand. A person who
is strongly formal and aggressive will view a less formal and mild person as the
Expresser or Harmonizer style. However to a 3rd party both of these two persons may
appear to be dominated by the Director style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make a Good Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presenting to a single person or a small group obviously you have to tailor
your presentation according to their communication styles. However when presenting
before a large and diverse crowd you need to account for all of them in the following
order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture the Expresser or promoting style by giving them a promise for something
cool and interesting. Because they easily forget details and become distracted you
can lose them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then capture the Director or dominant style by asserting your authority. State your
expertise in the field to establish trust. Also sell them the idea for efficiency
because this is the value they need to extract from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third comes the Harmonizer or supportive style. They seek open people to
connect with. Personal stories and struggles are the best way to engage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last comes the Thinker or analytical style. They need to know all the information
so you have to give them links and materials for further reading. It is also
a good idea to give them the ability to ask you questions later (via email, chat, etc)
because they will analyze your ideas and come up with more questions on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already started to organize my presentations based on the above 4 key points
so hopefully you will see me delivering better talks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Learned from IT Weekend</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-08T13:48:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-08:blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend.png" title="IT Weekend" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended the first &lt;a href="http://it-weekend.com"&gt;IT Weekend&lt;/a&gt; in Bulgaria.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. There were 20 people
attending and the format was very friendly and relaxed. The group had members with
various levels of experience and technical skills, also different areas they work in.
All presentations are on
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRA3tRwclRU&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.
Here's a brief of what happened and what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the honor to present in the first slot and gave a quick introduction
to mutation testing. This was my first time giving this talk and I'm not entirely
happy with how I've presented it. Also mutation testing is touching a lot on unit tests,
programming and source code which in some organizations goes to the devel department.
I think mutation testing is harder to understand from people not familiar with it
than I initially thought. I'm taking note to improve the way I present this topic
to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yavor Donev gave a good overview of Appium and how to use it on Android.
The most important question for me was "&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to utilize the same test suite
on Android and iOS, given that the environments are different&lt;/em&gt;". With this I mean
regardless of how much we try to make the same (native) app on both platforms
it will end up differently because the platforms are essentially different. For
example there is a different number of physical buttons available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that both iOS and Android apps follow the same design and use
similar workflow then it should be possible to create a test suite which is
platform aware and account for the minor differences. We're also adding
another layer of complexity by introducing the requirement that both apps stay
in sync with each other and account for the quirks of the foreign platform.
Depending on your apps and goals this may not be an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I didn't like about Appium is that upstream doesn't care much about
version compatibility and they tend to break and change stuff arbitrary between
releases. That said if it works, don't update it or otherwise be extremely
careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a nice chat with Yavor on the topic of career change, learning to
program and working with people who have very little coding experience. His
approach is to develop a higher level test framework on top of Appium which
his team mates can use more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aneta Petkova's &lt;em&gt;Selenium Grid in Unix Environment&lt;/em&gt; is a bit out of my domain.
However I took one important lesson: regardless of how great your tools are
there are minor details which can make or break your day. In her case these
are the physical location of the tests (e.g. which Selenium node runs them) and
access to shared resources. Turns out WebDriver doesn't give you
this information directly and you need to go through hoops to get it. Her
solution was to place the test code on the Grid Hub and provide a shared file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger lesson is: whenever you have to design an automated test environment
(aka test lab) make sure to evaluate your needs beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last talk was a guest appearance by Denitsa Evtimova. She is a QA architect
with 16 years of experience and presented the QA strategy at Paysafe group.
They have a large monolithic system (legacy code) and have adopted a pyramid
style approach to testing. Whenever possible tests are brought down to the lowest
level (e.g. unit tests) and not repeated on the higher levels. At the top
stand manual testing. Teams are small: 3-4 developers and 2-3 QAs. It is the team
responsibility to make sure tests are implemented at the lowest possible level.
The process is not strictly enforced and the company relies more on self
governance in this aspect. Also everyone on the team can contribute
additional tests whenever they see something missing.
Test (writing) tasks are all logged in JIRA. They are also small so that
everything can be completed in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was more informal. We did a quick exploratory testing
exercise and shared opinions on different test tools. Then the group had
a discussion about soft skills and how QA engineers can change the perception
of developers about the QA profession (especially in teams where there are many
manual testers). The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criticize the software, not the person, e.g. don't blame the person directly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate with concrete facts and data, not emotions and perceptions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes of the type "how many QA engineers are needed to screw a light bulb"
are a problem because they lead to underestimation of the job role;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it is not quite clear (to others) how the QA role contributes to
the development of the product and the organization;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a QA it is important to be able to give a non-biased opinion and
observations on what is happening with the product/process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A QA person needs to be very calm. They have to be able to listen to
everybody (especially developers) and accept their point of view but at
the same time also communicate their own point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important
to sit together with developers and observe the problem, brainstorm and
propose possible solutions. This also creates a feedback loop where the
developer feels empowered because he's part of the process identifying
the problem and proposing the best solution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In agile teams it is a good idea to rotate people between developer and
QA positions. This will help them better understand the job of others,
acquire new skills and also bring fresh thinking to the team;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance is an ungrateful job and only people with very calm and methodical
thinking (to follow through and write all possible scenarios) are able to excel
in this field. On the other hand developer usually think about the happy path
scenarios and strive to make their code work as best as they can;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By rotating job roles within the team developers
will quickly find out that testing is not their field and gain respect
towards their QA peers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US managers have the habit of telling "good job" to everyone, even for
small and routine tasks. In Bulgaria (and maybe elsewhere) we're not used
to this. Instead we're used of being scolded when we do something wrong.
If everything is good then we don't receive any recognition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the American "good job" is actually a good thing. Team mates will
start performing better over time because they will feel their work is
valued and not meaningless, they will feel recognized which will boost
morale and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>Peter Sabev on Test Automation</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/07/petar-sabev-on-test-automation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-07T11:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-07:blog/2016/10/07/petar-sabev-on-test-automation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the automation snake chart" src="/images/petar_sabev_automation.jpg" title="The automation snake chart" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Peter Sabev gave his talk
"On Reporting Bugs: Errors Made and Lessons learned" for DEV.bg
(&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVY3U58Js90&amp;amp;index=6&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;watch in Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;).
At the end of the talk there was a quick question how would he approach automation.
I have always approached automation in terms of manpower and skills available
within the team while he proposed an approach based on return of investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that you have a team with strong understanding of the
software (code) under test and they have good coding skills then start with the
hardest test cases first. This way the team will have lots of hard work
upfront and there will be some lead time without visible results.
However when the hardest/most complex test cases are already automated you
will most likely have covered a big portion of the SUT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, when you start with the easiest test cases first then
the team will progress gradually and have enough time to get to grips
with the SUT. You are also more likely to see more regressions or bugs
missed. With this approach every subsequent automated test will be harder
to write and more complex than the previous one. This is a good fit for
team who don't have strong experience with test automation and/or are
unfamiliar with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter proposes a different approach. He plots the test cases as dots, based
on how much time they take to execute manually and how much time/how hard
is it to automate the particular case. Then you start to move from the lower right
corner towards the upper left corner in a weaving motion, like a snake,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument is that once you automate the test cases which are not very complex
but require lots of time to execute by hand then you free up resources
within the team. As you progress up the chart the test cases become harder
to automate and yield less return of investment because they don't take
some much time to execute manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about Peter's approach please read
&lt;a href="http://waset.org/publications/10003250/manual-to-automated-testing-an-effort-based-approach-for-determining-the-priority-of-software-test-automation"&gt;his article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the snake chart the team constantly faces test scenarios
jumping up and down on the automation hardness scale. Which also means
that you need to have the suitable skills within the team. IMO this is best
suited for teams where each member has different degree of experience.
I'm also in favor of using the snake chart as a tool to distribute
automation tasks within the team.&lt;/p&gt;

testing be sure to follow &lt;a href="http://dev.bg"&gt;DEV.bg&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;As my frequent readers may know I try to summarize all the conferences
and events I go to. This year's EuRuKo inspired me to take a different
approach and instead of quickly summarizing the event I will try to
highlight what I have learned from it! My intention is to use this as a
tool to improve my skills and the work I do. It will probably be a long
post so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say that I don't consider myself a Ruby developer although I do
write a small amount of Ruby code. I also don't really consider myself a
developer although I have a formal degree in software engineering and do
my fair share of open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being different and thinking differently has always been helpful to me in
Quality Assurance and this time was no exception. Attending a conference
I knew nothing about and meeting with people whose job is totally different
than mine turned out to be my greatest experience on the conference circuit
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get out of the comfort zone, meet new
people, exchange ideas and learn!&lt;/strong&gt; The very fact that I am writing this post
not following my usual summary style proves this is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very early during the event I started to notice a recurring theme which grew
stronger by the minute. The Ruby community is very open and inclusive to newcomers
and they seem to be doing a very good job about on-boarding everyone who wants to
learn. I already wrote about Ivan Nemitchenko's
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/"&gt;experience of organizing remote internships&lt;/a&gt;
and there are also the Rails Girls local communities, the 
&lt;a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/"&gt;Rails Girls Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (didn't know about it)
and the various local Ruby communities who pitched their cities to host the next
EuRuKo. I really loved this feeling of community. In the broader Linux, Python and
QA world I have not seen this being so pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open up (the open source) community even more. Make it easier for newcomers to join!
Treat them as human and don't expect them to be like yourself. Do teach and mentor
both to help newcomers but also to help yourself become better!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly on par with my community work but I think I can do better. I will take
the time to evaluate what I've been doing in the past and identify areas for improvements.
I also encourage my readers and students to send me feedback as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned that junior developers can make meaningful
contributions to production grade code when they are given the appropriate set of tasks
and guidance. Stephanie Nemeth argued that companies should hire (more) enthusiastic
career changers as junior developers because they have very strong motivation for
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate how we look at junior developers, especially how we examine and hire them
and how we on-board them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lessons 2 and 3 are valid in the open source world and even more so in the
corporate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked the fact that some of the lightning talks were given by people who
had no previous experience in Ruby. @TeamJoda2016 talked about what they did and
learn throughout the summer and really cracked the room with their
"oh and btw we are looking for a job" as their final slide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are new/inexperienced at something don't be afraid to try it out. Give it
the best you've got and see how it goes. Worst case .... well nothing bad really happens,
best case you end up doing the best job in your life.&lt;/strong&gt; That's also been my
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/19/7-years-1400-bugs-red-hat-qa/"&gt;personal experience with software testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carina C. Zona's &lt;em&gt;Consequences Of An Insightful Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;
(old video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheE6udjfGI&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
dealt with the ethical
responsibilities of us as developers and this is becoming more common with deep learning neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re able to extract remarkably precise
intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn’t
consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krissy's &lt;em&gt;The HTT(Pancake) Request&lt;/em&gt; made a great analogy of consuming APIs with
your customer experience when visiting a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design APIs (software in general) as if that was a physical product where your
customers happiness matters&lt;/strong&gt;. We see this all the time in our daily jobs and we're
guilty of doing it as well. Btw at the moment I'm in the middle of huge refactoring
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit"&gt;django-chartit&lt;/a&gt; which breaks all
backwards compatibility. I guess I will have to re-evaluate my design and approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By accident I've made good friends with Alex Georgiev and the folks at Fyber.
I liked the fact that at the conference they had couple of people
working in QA and we managed to have a nice talk about QA vs developers and the transformation
between the two. That also touched on the bigger subject of testers not being able to
code and testers not being available for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving people to improve their skills (learn to code, write tests, etc) is possible
but needs to come from management, needs clear direction and also a little bit of peer pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all isn't that what an agile team is supposed to be ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now being the able to code, not entirely Ruby ignorant QA guy that I am I was
immediately offered several positions in London and Berlin (and no I'm still staying
in Sofia). As it turned out good QA engineers with good development skills are
in greater demand than developers not only in Sofia but all around the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellow QA guys, please do learn to program. Dear developers, please try thinking
more like a tester the next time you write code&lt;/strong&gt; (me included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring a barista and furnishing your company stand with the best coffee machine
you can afford while having an ugly hand written sign saying "MAIN CONFERENCE COFFEE -&amp;gt;"
is a marketing stunt that I really love. I'm not sure how well that worked for their
hiring but it got them visibility. I'm definitely stealing this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference coffee sucks. Provide better one and developers will queue at your stand.
To a greater extent - research your target and their needs and provide a product
that solves their problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we gave back&lt;/h2&gt;

EuRuKo yesterday
(slides &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/creatop/my-experiense-of-remote-internship-for-junior-ruby-developers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
I'm writing this because that was the best talk both
in terms of content and visual presentation I saw at the conference and because
it is closely related to my work with &lt;a href="http://hackbulgaria.com"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is that at some point Ivan was mentoring several junior developers
and saw the need to scale this effort so he did a call for interns and got back 60 replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What an Intern Gets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects in their portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working experience, including team work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing an entire product from idea to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan wanted to find suitable interns who have basic Ruby on Rails knowledge
and who could invest a minimum of 20 hours per week of their time so he devised
an aptitude test of 3 parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The three part test &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inem"&gt;@inem&lt;/a&gt; used to challenge 60 candidates for a Ruby internship. Pretty cool. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/euruko?src=hash"&gt;#euruko&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsnN03pXkf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsnN03pXkf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tatiana Stantonian (@binaryberry) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/binaryberry/status/779664766394564608"&gt;September 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 is developing basic functionality of the product.
Part 2 was adding different user types which require different validation logic, etc.
Part 3 was adding "purchasing" logic via external APIs. In Part 3 intentionally
there was no code review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was shit! That was the purpose of the test. The reasoning being that
there is no right or wrong way to solve the problems he presented to the interns. Instead
he wanted to make them think and decide on a solution. Then feel the pain of their decision.
Ivan argues that what made us senior developers are these pains we have experienced at some
point in our careers, those fuck-ups that we did in some old project. All of them made us
better in our job because we could learn from the mistakes we've made and more importantly
understand the consequence of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common mistakes Ivan saw were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring levels of abstraction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using too many gems without knowing or understanding their limitations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gems were treated as the only way to solve a problem. More importantly changing
this way was out of the question;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interns didn't know about &lt;a href="http://stevelorek.com/service-objects.html"&gt;service objects&lt;/a&gt;,
well even some experienced developers seem to not know that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business logic was all around the place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad naming all around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing Ivan did was a group hangout code review followed by a short lecture about
design patterns, a refactoring session and finally cross code review. At the end the
product was delivered as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following these initial efforts Ivan continued (with even more interns, or the next group of them I think)
by asking interns to develop internship automatization, that is a means for the system to
distribute tasks based on git commits, tags, etc so it can scale. They've added an admin
dashboard and started working on an open source alternative to NewRelic (if I got that correctly).
He was also able to enlist 2 more mentors to help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems Ivan found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough mentors and external projects to work on for all of the interns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating a project as not real (e.g. not a real world product) is a mistake;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A training project has the same management issues that a real product will have
and they need to be resolved in pretty much the same way;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was collective irresponsibility from the group of interns. They didn't do
what they said they will do;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were communication issues between the interns and the lack of enough mentors
was an obvious problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was also lack of motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say these are the typical problems one also sees in almost any teams. It doesn't
matter if these are teams of students or teams of developers inside some company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What a Junior Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A real project to work on;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A business context, a reason why something should be done and why it needs to be
done in a particular way&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some visible achievement for their portfolio;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team work experience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole cycle development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan thinks that &lt;strong&gt;the aptitude test worked great&lt;/strong&gt; because his interns were able to find
good jobs afterwards but he will change a few things. There will be even more tests
and he will reject unfit/bad interns. He will also do call for mentors not only for interns.
And he wants to turn mentors' experience into tests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the "business context" item. IMO even seasoned developers need to have this
if they are expected to create a great product for their company. We're not just coders but
sometimes companies forget that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also wondering how can I apply a similar aptitude test in my work (both mentoring at
HackBulgaria and otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How about Senior Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all have routine tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and research tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice to have features and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low priority features;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side project ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing features in their favorite open source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior developers' tasks and desires will have to align with what a junior needs in order
for the mentorship to work. As senior devs we often make a mistake and expect everyone else
to think the same way we do and act as fast as we do. &lt;strong&gt;Ideally senior developers want to have multiple clones
of ourselves to work with!&lt;/strong&gt; I myself have been guilty of that and trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of a for-profit company the above findings should be taken into deep consideration
if you are about to have interns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk I was lucky to talk to Ivan and tell him more about the training sessions
at HackBulgaria. I also proposed to him the sponsorship model which he hasn't considered.
He then made a counter offer: ask interns for high payment upfront and let them recoup that
based on their progress towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really happy to have heard this presentation and being able to talk to Ivan in person. I also have
my notes about my "QA and Automation 101" training at HackBulgaria and I now
have a better idea how to go about organizing and summarizing them (will try to publish that soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Ivan works at GitLab and promised to look at an issue I personally have
so here it is &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/7953"&gt;GitLab #7953&lt;/a&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/617994718381217/"&gt;Questers Beer'n'Code Day&lt;/a&gt;
which was an open air mini-conference held at the terrace of their office.
As to organization the only drawback was the summer sun which made it impossible
to see anything on the screen. Most speakers were OK with that although they
wanted to show some code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recorded all talks and they are available in my
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2ILL8Xq5s&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;TECH TALKS&lt;/a&gt;
YouTube play list. You can also hear me asking some questions from behind
the camera. All of the talks are in Bulgarian though, so sorry for my
English speaking readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon started with Lidiya Georgieva and her talk about clean code
and code smells. I find the topic particularly interesting but she didn't
go into more details. She said she had used SonarCube but couldn't recommend
any other tools, except for the standard lint style ones. I have been using
&lt;a href="https://landscape.io/github/MrSenko/pelican-ab/"&gt;LandScape.io&lt;/a&gt; for all
Python based code I've been working on recently and I think it is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talk I found interesting was by my fellow QA Petar Sabev on reporting
bugs. It was more of an entry level talk, but still very informative for both
less experienced QAs and other technical folks so I definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one, and most interesting, was Bogoi Bogdanov with Scaling Agile.
Despite the name
he covered some basics about Agile and what it actually is. Afterwards we've stayed
and talked for a good 2 hours more. I definitely would like to hear more from
him in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to Questers for hosting this event and allowing me to record it.

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Oct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unorderable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the second elements in both lists have different keys
and Python doesn't know how to compare them. In earlier Python versions
this has been special cased as
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3484293/is-there-a-description-of-how-cmp-works-for-dict-objects-in-python-2/3484456#3484456"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;
by Ned Batchelder (the author of Python's coverage tool) but in Python 3
dictionaries have no natural sort order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;django-chartit&lt;/em&gt; (of which I'm now the official maintainer) this
bug triggers when you want to plot data from multiple sources (models) on the same
chart. In this case the fields coming from each data series are different and the
above error is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked around this in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit/commit/9d9033ecd5a8592a12872293cdf6d710cebf894f"&gt;commit 9d9033e&lt;/a&gt;
by simply disabling an iterator sort but this is sub-optimal and I'm not quite certain
what the side effect might be. I suspect you may end up with a chart where the order
of values on the X axis isn't the same for the different models, e.g. one graph plotting
the data in ascending order the other one in descending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble also comes from the fact that we're sorting an iterator (a list of fields) by
telling Python to use a list of dicts to determine the sort order. In this arrangement
there is no way to tell Python how we want to compare our dicts. The only solution I
can think about is creating a custom class and implementing a custom &lt;code&gt;__cmp__()&lt;/code&gt; method
for this data structure!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>PhantomJS 2.1.1 in Ubuntu different from upstream</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/07/23/phantomjs-211-in-ubuntu-different-from-upstream/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-23T11:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-07-23:blog/2016/07/23/phantomjs-211-in-ubuntu-different-from-upstream/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some time now I've been hitting
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12506"&gt;PhantomJS #12506&lt;/a&gt; with the
latest 2.1.1 version. The problem is supposedly fixed in 2.1.0 but this is not
always the case. If you use a .deb package from the latest Ubuntu then the problem
still exists, see
&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/phantomjs/+bug/1605628"&gt;Ubuntu #1605628&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the root cause of this, and probably other problems, is the way
PhantomJS packages are built. Ubuntu builds the package against their stock
Qt5WebKit libraries which leads to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ldd usr/lib/phantomjs/phantomjs &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep -i qt

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While building from the upstream sources gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ldd /tmp/bin/phantomjs &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep -i qt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you take a closer look at PhantomJS's sources you will notice there are
3 git submodules in their repository - &lt;code&gt;3rdparty&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;qtbase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qtwebkit&lt;/code&gt;.
Then in their &lt;code&gt;build.py&lt;/code&gt; you can clearly see that this local fork of &lt;code&gt;QtWebKit&lt;/code&gt;
is built first, then the &lt;code&gt;phantomjs&lt;/code&gt; binary is built against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these custom forks include additional patches to make
WebKit suitable for Phantom's needs. And these patches are not available
in the stock WebKit library that Ubuntu uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's correct. We need additional functionality that
vanilla QtWebKit doesn't have. That's why we use custom version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitaly Slobodin, PhantomJS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment of this writing Vitaly's qtwebkit fork is 28 commits ahead and
39 commits behind qt:dev. I'm surprised Ubuntu's PhantomJS even works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution IMO is to bundle the additional sources into the src.deb package
and use the same building procedure as upstream.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category></entry><entry><title>On Python Infinite Loops</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/07/15/on-python-infinite-loops/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-15T09:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-07-15:blog/2016/07/15/on-python-infinite-loops/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you write an endless loop without using &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, number constants
and comparison operators in Python ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working on the mutation test tool
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray"&gt;Cosmic Ray&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that it
was missing a boolean replacement operator, that is an operator which will switch
&lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; and vice versa, so I wrote one. I've also added some tests to
Cosmic Ray's test suite and then I hit the infinite loop problem.
CR's test suite contains the following code inside a module called &lt;code&gt;adam.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The test suite executes mutations on &lt;code&gt;adam.py&lt;/code&gt; and then runs some tests which
it expects to fail. During execution one of the mutations is
&lt;code&gt;replace break with continue&lt;/code&gt; which makes the above loop infinite. The test suite
times out after a while and kills the mutation. Everything fails as expected and
we're good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding my boolean replacement operator broke this function. All of the other mutations
work as expected but then the loop becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When we test this particular mutation there is no infinite loop so Cosmic Ray's
test suite doesn't time out like it should and an error is reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;job ID 25:Outcome.SURVIVED:adam
command: cosmic-ray worker adam boolean_replacer 2 unittest -- tests
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;--- mutation diff ---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;--- a/home/travis/build/MrSenko/cosmic-ray/test_project/adam.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+++ b/home/travis/build/MrSenko/cosmic-ray/test_project/adam.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gu"&gt;@@ -32,6 +32,6 @@&lt;/span&gt;
     return x
 
 def trigger_infinite_loop():
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-    while True:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+    while False:&lt;/span&gt;
         break
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So the question becomes how to write the loop condition in such a way that nothing
will mutate it but it will still remain true so that when &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;
this piece of code will become an infinite loop ? Using &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; constants
obviously is a no go. Same goes for numeric constants, e.g. &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or comparison
operators like &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;, etc. - all of them will be mutated and will
break the loop condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took a look at the docs for
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html"&gt;truth value testing&lt;/a&gt; and discovered
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/pull/155"&gt;my solution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm creating an object instance here which will not be mutated by any of the
existing mutation operators.&lt;/p&gt;

the HTML is no longer updated and the default values are shown, which in

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I visited &lt;a href="http://tuxcon.mobi"&gt;TuxCon&lt;/a&gt; in Plovdiv and
was very happy to meet and talk to some of the creators of the Puldin
computer! On the picture above are (left to right) Dimitar Georgiev
- wrote the text editor, Ivo Nenov - BIOS, DOS and core OS developer,
Nedyalko Todorov - director of the vendor company and Orlin Shopov -
BIOS, DOS, compiler and core OS developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puldin is 100% pure Bulgarian development, while the “Pravetz” brand
was copy of Apple ][ (Pravetz 8A, 8C, 8M), Oric (Pravets 8D) and IBM-PC
(Pravetz 16). The Puldin computers were build from scratch both hardware
and software and were produced in Plovdiv in the late 80s and early 90s.
50000 pieces were made, at least 35000 of them have been exported to Russia
and paid for. A typical configuration in a Russian class room consisted of
several Puldin computers and a single Pravetz 16. According to Russian sources
the last usage of these computers was in 2003 serving as Linux terminals
and being maintained without any support from the vendor
(b/c it ceased to exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Puldin 601" src="/images/puldin601.jpg" title="Puldin 601" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main objectives of Puldin was full compatibility with IBM-PC.
At the time IBM had been releasing extensive documentation about how their
software and hardware works which has been used by Puldin's creators as
their software specs. Despite IBM-PC using faster CPU the Puldin 601 had
a comparable performance due to aggressive software and compiler optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing wise the guys used to compare Puldin's functionality with that of IBM-PC.
It was a hard requirement to have full compatibility on the file storage layer,
that means floppy disks written on Puldin had to be readable on IBM-PC and vice
versa. Same goes for programs compiled on Puldin - they had to execute on IBM-PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything of course had been tested manually and on top of that all the software
had to be burned to ROM before you can do anything with it. As you can imagine the
testing process had been quite slow and painful compared to today's standards.
I've asked the guys if they'd happened to find a bug in IBM-PC which wasn't present
in their code but they couldn't remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was interesting for me on the hardware side was the fact that you can plug
the computer directly to a cheap TV set and that it's been one of the first computers
which could operate on 12V DC, powered directly from a car battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pravetz 8" src="/images/pravetz16.jpg" title="Pravetz 8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a fully functional Pravetz 8 with an additional VGA port to
connect it to the LCD monitor as well as a SD card reader wired to function as a
floppy disk reader (the small black dot behind the joystick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who missed it (and understand Bulgarian) I have a

coverage or in terms of testing more use-cases aka behavior scenarios. Both
are valid approaches to improve testing and both of them seem to focus
around execution control flow (or business logic). However program behavior
is sometimes controlled via the contents of its data structures and this is
something which is rarely tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/26#discussion_r32790705"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;
Brian C. Lane and Vratislav Podzimek from Red Hat are talking about a data structure
which maps Fedora versions to particular implementations of kickstart commands.
For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RHEL7Handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RHEL7&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;commandMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;auth&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;authconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FC3_Authconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;authconfig&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;authconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FC3_Authconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;autopart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;autopart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;F20_AutoPart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;autostep&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;autostep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FC3_AutoStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;bootloader&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bootloader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RHEL7_Bootloader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In their particular case the Fedora 21 &lt;code&gt;logvol&lt;/code&gt; implementation introduced the
&lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; parameter but in
Fedora 22 and Fedora 23 the &lt;code&gt;logvol&lt;/code&gt; command mapped to the Fedora 20 implementation and the
&lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; parameter wasn't available. This is unexpected change in program behavior
although the &lt;code&gt;logvol.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handlers/f22.py&lt;/code&gt; files have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/atodorov/pykickstart-coverage/blob/master/coverage-report.log"&gt;99% and 100% code coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I did some coding and created an automated test for this problem. The test
iterates over all command maps. For each command in the map (that is data structure member)
we load the module which provides all possible implementations for that command. In the
loaded module
we search for implementations which have newer versions than what is in the map,
but not newer than the current Fedora version under test. With a little bit of pruning
the current list of offenses is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ERROR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;devel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;fcoe&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;maps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;F13_Fcoe&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first two are possibly false negatives or related to the naming conventions used
in this module. However the rest appear to be legitimate problems. The &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; command
has introduced the &lt;code&gt;--groups&lt;/code&gt; parameter in Fedora 24 (devel is Fedora 25 currently) but the
parser will fail to recognize this parameter. The &lt;code&gt;logvol&lt;/code&gt; problem is recognized as well
since it was never patched. And the Fedora 18 &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt; command implements a new property called
&lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt; which has probably never been available to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow my current work in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/91"&gt;PR #91&lt;/a&gt; and happy testing your

I've written a bit about &lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/categories/samsung/"&gt;their bugs&lt;/a&gt; previously.
However I didn't expect them to release Android 6.0.1 and render my
&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1tiiqze"&gt;Galaxy S5&lt;/a&gt; completely useless with respect
to the feature I use the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lockscreen" src="/images/samsung/lockscreen_bug.jpg" title="Lockscreen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tell me the weather for Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Monday I've let Android upgrade to 6.0.1 to be completely surprised
that the lockscreen shows the weather report for Brussels, while
I'm based in Sofia. I've checked &lt;em&gt;AccuWeather&lt;/em&gt; (I did go to
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/"&gt;Brussels earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;)
but it displayed only Sofia and Thessaloniki. To get rid of this widget
go to &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Lockscreen -&amp;gt; Additional information&lt;/code&gt; and turn it off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this weather report comes from GPS/Location based data, which I
have turned off by default but did use a while back ago. After turning
the widget off and back on it didn't appear on the lockscreen. I suspect
they fall back to showing the last good known value when data is missing
instead of handling the error properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apps are gone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my installed apps are missing now. So far I've noticed that the
&lt;em&gt;Gallery&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S Health&lt;/em&gt; icons have disappeared from my homescreen. I think
&lt;em&gt;S Health&lt;/em&gt; came from Samsung's app store but still they shouldn't have removed
it silently. Now I wonder what happened to my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see why &lt;em&gt;Gallery&lt;/em&gt; was removed though. The only way to view pictures
is to use the camera app preview functionality which is kind of grose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grayscale in powersafe mode is gone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killer feature on these higher end Galaxy devices is the &lt;em&gt;Powersafe mode&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;Ultra Powersafe mode&lt;/em&gt;. I use them a lot and by default have my phone in
&lt;em&gt;Powersafe mode&lt;/em&gt; with grayscale colors enabled. It is easier on the eyes and
also safes your battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; grayscale colors don't affect some displays but these devices use
AMOLED screens which need different amounts of power to display different
colors. More black means less power required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the upgrade grayscale is no more. There's not even an on/off switch.
I've managed to find a workaround though. First you need to enable developer mode
by tapping 7 times on &lt;code&gt;About device -&amp;gt; Build number&lt;/code&gt;. Then go to
&lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Developer options&lt;/code&gt;, look for the &lt;code&gt;Hardware Accelerated Rendering&lt;/code&gt;
section and select &lt;code&gt;Simulate Color Space -&amp;gt; Monochromacy&lt;/code&gt;! This is a bit ugly
hack and doesn't have the convenience of turning colors on/off by tapping
the quick Powersafe mode button at the top of the screen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like Samsung didn't think this upgrade well enough or didn't test it
well enough ? In my line of work (installation and upgrade testing) I've rarely
seen such a big blunder.

QA candidates. Today I'm quoting an excerpt from the book
&lt;a href="http://it-interviews.com/"&gt;Mission: My IT career&lt;/a&gt;(Bulgarian only) by Ivaylo Hristov,
one of &lt;a href="http://komfo.com"&gt;Komfo&lt;/a&gt;'s co-founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fedora pen" src="/images/fedora/pen.png" title="Fedora pen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Probably the most important personal trait of a QA engineer is to
be able to think outside given boundaries and prejudices
(about software that is). When necessary to be non-conventional and
apply different approaches to the problems being solved. This will help
them find defect which nobody else will notice.

Most often errors/mistakes in software development are made due to
wrong expectations or wrong assumptions. Very often this happens because
developers hope their software will be used in one particular way
(as it was designed to) or that a particular set of data will be returned.
Thus the skill to think outside the box is the most important skill
we (as employers) are looking to find in a QA candidate. At job interviews
you can expect to be given tasks and questions which examine those skills.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;How would you test a pen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Ivaylo's favorite question for QA candidates. He's looking for
attention to details and knowing when to stop testing. Some of the possible
answers related to core functionality are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the pen write in the correct color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the color fades over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the pen operate normally at various temperatures? What temperature
  intervals would you choose for testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the pen operate normally at various atmospheric pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing, does the pen leave excessive ink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing, do you get a continuous line or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What pressure does the user need to apply in order to write a
  continuous line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What surfaces can the pen write on? What surfaces would you test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you able to write on a piece of paper if there is something soft underneath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the maximum inclination angle at which the pen is able to write
  without problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the ink dry fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we spill different liquids onto a sheet of paper, on which we had written
  something, does the ink stay intact or smear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you use pencil rubber to erase the ink? What else would you test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long can you write before we run out of ink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How fat is the ink line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ivaylo gives a few more non-obvious answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that all labels on the pen/ink cartridge are correctly spelled
  and how durable they are (try to erase them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength test - what is the maximum height you can drop the pen from
  without breaking it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that dimensions are correct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test if the pen keeps writing after not being used for some time
  (how long)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing individual pen components under different temperature and
  atmospheric conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that materials used to make the pen are safe, e.g. when you put
  the pen in your mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When should you stop ? According to the book there can be between 50 and 100
test cases for a single pen, maybe more. It's not a good sign if you stop at
the first 3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what skills are revealed via these questions please
read my other posts on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

working with - a test which submits a web form appeared to fail at a rate
between 10% and 30%. This immediately made me think there is some kind of
race-condition but it turned out that Capybara's &lt;code&gt;find().click&lt;/code&gt; method
doesn't always fire the onClick event in the browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test suite uses Capybara, Poltergeist and PhantomJS. The element we
click on is an image, coupled to a hidden check-box underneath. When the image
is clicked onClick is fired and the check-box is updated accordingly. In the
failed cases the underlying check-box wasn't updated!
Searching the web reveals a similar problem described by
&lt;a href="http://aokolish.me/blog/2012/01/22/testing-hover-events-with-capybara/"&gt;Alex Okolish&lt;/a&gt;
so we've tried his solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;.replacement&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;How to Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure behavior being somewhat flaky I've opted for running the
test multiple times and see what happens when it fails. Initially I've
executed the test in batches of 10 and 20 repetitions to get a feeling
of how often does it fail before proceeding with debugging. Debugging
was done by logging variables and state on the console and repeating
multiple times. Once a possible solution was
proposed we've run the tests in batches of 100 repetitions and counted
how often they failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, when Alex's solution was discovered we've repeated the
testing around 1000 times just to make sure it works reliably.
So far this has been working without issues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent around a week working on this together with a co-worker
and we didn't really want to spend more time trying to figure out
what was going wrong with our tools. Once we saw that &lt;code&gt;trigger&lt;/code&gt; does
the job we didn't continue debugging Capybara or PhantomJS.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="Ruby"></category></entry><entry><title>DEVit Conf 2016</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/05/25/devit-conf-2016/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-05-25T16:01:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-05-25:blog/2016/05/25/devit-conf-2016/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been another busy week after &lt;a href="http://devitconf.org/"&gt;DEVit conf&lt;/a&gt; took place in
Thessaloniki. Here are my impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DEVit 2016" src="/images/devit2016.jpg" title="DEVit 2016" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://techministry.gr"&gt;TechMinistry&lt;/a&gt; is Thessaloniki's hacker space which
is hosted at a central location, near major shopping streets.
I've attended an
&lt;a href="http://discourse.techministry.gr/t/18-05-2016-19-30-open-source-wednesday/67"&gt;Open Source Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;
meeting. From the event description I thought that
there was going to be a discussion about getting involved with
Firefox. However that was not the case.
Once people started coming in they formed organic groups and
started discussing various topics on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also shown their 3D printer which IMO is the most precise of 3D printers
I've seen so far. Imagine what it would be like to click &lt;em&gt;Print&lt;/em&gt;, sometime
in the future, and have your online orders appear on your desk over night.
That would be quite cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've met with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bacharakis"&gt;Christos Bacharakis&lt;/a&gt;, a Mozilla
representative for Greece, who gave me some goodies for my students at HackBulgaria!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I spent the day merging pull requests for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme"&gt;MrSenko/pelican-octopress-theme&lt;/a&gt;
and attended the DEVit Speakers dinner at
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/massaliathessaloniki/"&gt;Massalia&lt;/a&gt;.
Food and drinks were very good and I even found a new recipe for mushrooms with
ouzo, of which I think I had a bit too many :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also told that &lt;em&gt;"a full stack developer is a developer who can introduce
a bug to every layer of the software stack"&lt;/em&gt;. I can't agree more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DEVit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference day started with a huge delay due to long queues for registration.
The fist talk I attended, and the best one IMO was
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCGBgI1MNwE&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;Need It Robust? Make It Fragile!&lt;/a&gt;
by Yegor Bugayenko (watch the video). There he talked about two different approaches to writing
software: fail safe vs. fail fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that when software is designed to
fail fast bugs are discovered earlier in the development cycle/software lifetime
and thus are easier to fix, making the whole system more robust and more stable.
On the other hand when software is designed to hide failures and tries to
recover auto-magically the same problems remain hidden for longer and when they
are finally discovered they are harder to fix. This is mostly due to the fact that
the original error condition is hidden and manifested in a different way which
makes it harder to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegor made several examples, all of which are valid code, which he considers
bad practice. For example imagine we have a function that accepts a filename
as parameter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_file_fail_safe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# read the file, do something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bytes_read&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_file_fail_fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;File does not exist&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# read the file, do something else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bytes_read&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first example &lt;code&gt;read_file_fail_safe&lt;/code&gt; returns -1 on error. The trouble is
whoever is calling this method may not check for errors thus corrupting the
flow of the program further down the line. You may also want to collect metrics and
update your database with the number of bytes processed - this will totally
skew your metrics. C programmers out there will quickly remember at least
one case when they didn't check the return code for errors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example &lt;code&gt;read_file_fail_fast&lt;/code&gt; will raise an exception the moment
it encounters a problem. It's not its fault that the file doesn't exist and
there's nothing it can do about it, nor is its job to do anything about it.
Raising an exception will surface back to the caller and they will be notified
about the problem, taking appropriate actions to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegor was also unhappy that many books teach fail safe and even IDEs (for Java)
generate fail safe boiler-plate code (need to check this)!
Indeed it is me who asks the first question
&lt;em&gt;Are there any tools to detect fail safe code patterns?&lt;/em&gt; and it turns out there aren't
(for the majority of cases that is). If you happen to know such a tool
please post a link in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit disappointed by the rest of the talks. They were all high-level
overviews IMO and didn't go deep technical. Last year was better. I also
wanted to attend the GitHub Patchwork workshop but looking at the agenda
it looked like this is for users who are starting with git and GitHub
(which I'm not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing session of the day was
&lt;em&gt;"Real time front-end alchemy, or: capturing, playing, altering and encoding
video and audio streams, without servers or plugins!"&lt;/em&gt; by Soledad Penades from
Mozilla. There she gave a demo about the latest and greatest in terms of
audio and video capturing, recording and mixing natively in the browser.
This is definitively very cool for apps in the audio/video space but I can
also imagine an application for us software testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on computational and memory requirements you should be able to
record everything the user does in their browser (while on your website)
and send it back home when they want to report an error or contact support.
Definitely better than screenshots and having to go back and forth until
the exact steps to reproduce are established.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fedora.planet"></category><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Changing Rails consider_all_requests_local in RSpec fails</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/27/changing-rails-consider_all_requests_local-in-rspec-fails/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-27T15:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-04-27:blog/2016/04/27/changing-rails-consider_all_requests_local-in-rspec-fails/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many others I've been trying to change
&lt;code&gt;Rails.application.config.consider_all_requests_local&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions&lt;/code&gt; inside my
RSpec tests in order to test custom error pages in a Rails app. However this
doesn't work. My code looked like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;feature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Exceptions&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;action_dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show_exceptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;consider_all_requests_local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This works only if I execute &lt;code&gt;exceptions_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt; alone. However when something
else executes before that it fails. The config values are
correctly updated but that doesn't seem to have effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer and solution comes from
&lt;a href="http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/08/404-with-rails-4/#comment-1714338343"&gt;Henrik N&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;action_dispatch.show_exceptions gets copied and cached in
Rails.application.env_config, so even if you change
Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions in this
before block the value isn't what you expect when it's used in
ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact &lt;code&gt;DebugExceptions&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;env['action_dispatch.show_exceptions']&lt;/code&gt;. The
correct code should look like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:env_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;receive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:env_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;no_args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;action_dispatch.show_exceptions&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;action_dispatch.show_detailed_exceptions&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;consider_all_requests_local&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This allows the test to work regardless of the order of execution
of spec files. I don't know why but I also had to leave
&lt;code&gt;show_detailed_exceptions&lt;/code&gt; otherwise I wasn't getting the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="Ruby"></category></entry></feed>
