&lt;p&gt;In early December'16 together with my 5 year old daughter we visited an introductory workshop
about the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; book and another
workshop organized by &lt;a href="http://coderdojobulgaria.com/"&gt;Coder Dojo Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.
Later that month we also visited a &lt;a href="http://www.roboleague.bg/"&gt;Robo League&lt;/a&gt;
competition in Sofia.
The goal was to further Adriana's interest into technical topics and programming in
particular and see how she will respond to the topics covered and the
workshops and training materials format in general. I have been keeping
detailed notes and today I'm publishing some of my observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events that we visited were strictly for small children and there were mentors
who worked with the kids. Each mentor, depending on the event works with up to 4 or 5
children. Parents were not allowed to interfere and I have been keeping
my distance on purpose, trying to observe and document as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; is a small book with colorful illustrations
about a girl who embarks on adventures in programming. Adriana considers it a fairy tale
although the book introduces lots of IT related terms - Ruby and gems, Firefox,
Snow Leopard, Django, etc. For a child these don't necessarily mean anything
but she was able to recognize my Red Hat fedora which was depicted on one of the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop itself was the introduction of the Bulgarian translation, which I've purchased,
and had the kids build a laptop using glue and paper icons. Mentors were explaining
to the children what the various icons mean, that viruses are a bad thing for your computer,
what a CPU and computer memory are
and everything else in between. A month later when Adriana started building a new
paper computer on her own (without being provoked by me) she told me that the
colored icons were "information" that goes into the computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the story part of the book there are exercises designed to create analytical
thinking. We did only a few in the beginning where she had to create a list of
action sequence how to make the bed or get dressed up in the morning, etc. At the time
Adriana didn't receive the game very well and was having some troubles figuring out
the smaller actions that comprise a larger activity. We didn't follow through with
the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code.org&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the second event she was exposed to &lt;a href="https://studio.code.org/"&gt;studio.code.org&lt;/a&gt;!
At the time we were required to bring a working laptop and a mouse. I had no idea
how these were going to be used. It turned out mentors gave each child a training
course from code.org according to their age. Adriana started with the Course #1
because she can't read on her own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seemed to me that Adi was a bit bored and didn't know what to do,
staring cluelessly at the screen. Btw this was her first session working with
a computer on her own. After a while the mentor came and I guess explained what
needs to be done, how the controls work and what the objective of the exercise was.
After that I noticed she's working more independently and grew interested in the
subject. She had a problem working with the mouse and after 2 days I've nudged
her to use the TrackPoint and mouse buttons on a ThinkPad laptop. She uses them
with both hands, so am I btw, and is much more adept at controlling the cursor
that way. If you are going to teach children how to work effectively with a computer
you may as well start with teaching them to work effectively with a track pad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courses are comprised of games and puzzles (which she's very good at)
asking children to perform a very basic programming concept. For example instruct
an angry bird to move left or right by using blocks for each instruction.
By the time the workshop was over Adriana had completed 4 levels on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 5 introduced a button for step-by-step execution of the program also
colloquially known as debugging :). The first few exercises she had no idea
what to do with this debugging button. Then the 6th exercise introduced a
wrong starting sequence and everything snapped into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 7 introduced additional instructions. There are move left/right instructions
as well as visit a flower and make honey instruction. This level also introduces
repeating instructions, for example make honey 2 times. At first that was confusing
but then she started to take a notice at the numbers shown on screen and started to
figure out how to build the proper sequence of blocks to complete the game.
When she made mistakes she used the debugging button to figure out which block
was not in place and remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this level Adi started making more mistakes, but more importantly she also
started trying to figure them out on her own. My help was limited to asking
questions like "what do you need to do", "where are you at the screen now",
"what instructions do you need to execute to get where you want to be".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 8 introduces a new type of game, drawing shapes on the screen. The hardest
part here is that you need to jump from one node to another sometimes. This
is great for improving the child spatial orientation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 11 is a reading game in English. You need to instruct a bee to fly across
different letters to complete a word shown on the screen. However Adriana can't
read much less in English, although she understands and speaks English
well for her age. In this case I believe she relied on pattern recognition
to complete all exercises in this level. She would look at the target word
and then identify the letters on the playing board. Next she would stack instruction
blocks to program the movements of the bee towards her goal as in previous exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 13 introduces loops. It took Adriana 7 exercises to figure out what a loop
is, identify the various elements of it and how to construct it properly.
She also said that was amusing to her. Almost immediately she was able to identify
the length of the loop by herself and construct loops with only 1 block inside
their body. Loops with 2 or more blocks inside their body were a bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 14 introduced nested loops, usually one or more instruction blocks paired
with a loop block, nested inside another loop block. For example:
&lt;code&gt;repeat 3 times(move left, repeat 2 times(move down))&lt;/code&gt;. Again it took her about 6
exercises to figure them out. This is roughly at the middle of the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 16 was quite hard. It had blocks with parameters where you have to type
in some words and animal characters will "speak these words" as if in a comic book.
I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a text to speech engine integrated for
this level but sounds like a good idea. Anyhow this level was not on-par with
her skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course completed with free range drawing using instruction blocks and cycles.
The image she drew was actually her name where she had to guess how much scribbles
the painter needs to do in one direction, then traverse back and go into another direction.
She also had to figure out how big each letter needs to be so that it is possible to
actually draw it given the game limitations in motion and directions. This final level
required lot of my help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never had any doubts that small children are very clever and
capable of understanding enormous amounts of information and new concepts.
However I'm amazed by how deep their understanding goes and how fast they
are able to apply the new things they learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through games and practical workshops I believe it is very easy to teach
children to gain valuable skills for engineering professions. Even if they
don't end up in engineering the ability to clearly define goals and instructions,
break down complex tasks into small chunks and clearly communicate intentions
is a great advantage. So is the ability to analyze the task on your own and
use simple building blocks to achieve larger objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to keep notes on Adi's progress but will very likely write
about it less frequently. If you do have small children around you please
introduce them to &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2ijQlBD"&gt;Hello Ruby&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://studio.code.org/"&gt;studio.code.org&lt;/a&gt; and help them learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="fedora.qa"></category></entry><entry><title>Circo loco 2017</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2017/01/03/circo-loco-2017/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2017-01-03T09:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2017-01-03:blog/2017/01/03/circo-loco-2017/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HackConf 2016" src="/images/hack_conf.jpg" title="HackConf 2016" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to popular demand I'm sharing my plans for the upcoming conference season.
Here is a list of events I plan to visit and speak at (hopefully). The list
will be updated throughout the year so please subscribe to the comments section
to receive a notification when that happens! I'm open to meeting new people so
ping me for a beer if you are attending some of these events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;02 February - Hack Belgium Pre-Event Workshops, Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: added on Jan 12th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I had an amazing time visiting an
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/"&gt;Elixir &amp;amp; Erlang workshop&lt;/a&gt; so
I'm about to repeat the experience. I will be visiting a
&lt;a href="http://www.hackathon.com/event/hack-belgium-pre-event-workshops-29372270251"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;
organized by HackBelgium and keep you posted with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;03 February - Git Merge, Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: added on Jan 12th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://git-merge.com/"&gt;Git Merge&lt;/a&gt; is organized by GitHub and will be held in Brussels
this year. I will be visiting only the conference track and giving a lightning talk
titled &lt;em&gt;Automatic upstream dependency testing with GitHub API&lt;/em&gt;! That and the afterparty
of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;04-05 February - FOSDEM, Brussels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; is the largest free and open source gathering
in Europe which I have been visiting since 2009 (IIRC). You can checkout some
of my reports about
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-1-python-stands-lightning-talks/"&gt;FOSDEM 2014, Day 1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/"&gt;FOSDEM 2014, Day 2&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/"&gt;FOSDEM 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will present my
&lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/mutant_testing/"&gt;Mutants, tests and zombies&lt;/a&gt;
talk at the &lt;em&gt;Testing &amp;amp; Automation devroom&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. With a bit more luck I may be
presenting a second talk at the &lt;em&gt;Python devroom&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be in Brussels between February 1st and 5th to explore the local
start-up scene and get to meet with the Python community so ping me if you are around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18 March - QA Challenge Accepted 3.0, Sofia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://qachallengeaccepted.com/"&gt;QA: Challenge Accepted&lt;/a&gt; is a specialized QA conference
in Sofia and most of the sessions are in Bulgarian. I've visited last year and it was great.
I even proposed a &lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/03/25/hello-world-qa-challenge/"&gt;challenge of my own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFP is still open but I have a strong confidence that my talk
&lt;em&gt;Testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux the MicroSoft way&lt;/em&gt; will be approved. It will describe
a large scale experiment with pairwise testing, which btw I learned about at
QA: Challenge Accepted 2.0 :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;07-08 April - Bulgaria Web Summit, Sofia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a moderator at
&lt;a href="https://bulgariawebsummit.com/"&gt;Bulgaria Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; for several years and this year
is no exception. This is one of the strongest events held in Sofia and is in English.
Last year over 60% of the attendees were from abroad so you are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to speak at this event but will record as much of it
as possible. Checkout earlier recordings on my
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel
and hurry up because tickets are almost sold out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10-12 May - Romanian Testing Conference, Cluj-Napoca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://romaniatesting.ro/"&gt;RTC'17&lt;/a&gt; is a new event I found in neighboring Romania.
The topic this year is &lt;em&gt;Thriving and remaining relevant in Quality Assurance&lt;/em&gt;. My talk is titled
&lt;em&gt;Quality Assistance in the Brave New World&lt;/em&gt; where I'll share some experiences
and visions for the QA profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out I know a few people living in Cluj so I'll be arriving one day earlier
on May 9th to meet the locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;13-15 May - OSCAL, Tirana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/"&gt;Open Source Conference Albania&lt;/a&gt; is the largest OSS event in
the country. I'm on a row here to explore the IT scene on the Balkans. Due to traveling
constraints my availability will be limited to the conference venue only but I've booked
a hotel across the street :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be meeting a few friends in Tirana and hear about the progress of an
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/21/women-in-open-source/"&gt;psychological experiment&lt;/a&gt; we devised
with Jona Azizaj and Suela Palushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking wise I'm hoping to get the chance of introducing mutation testing and
even host a workshop on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;20-21 May - DEVit, Thessaloniki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd edition of &lt;a href="http://devitconf.org/"&gt;DEVit&lt;/a&gt;,
the 360° web development conference of Northern Greece. I've been a regular
visitor since the beginning and this year I've proposed a session on mutation
testing. Because the Thessaloniki community seems more interested in Ruby and Rails
my goal is to share more examples from my Ruby work and compare how that is different
from the Python world. There is once again an opportunity for a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I've been the only Bulgarian to visit DEVit and also locally known as
"The guy who Kosta &amp;amp; Kosta met in Sofia"! Checkout my impressions from
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/05/22/devit-conf-2015-impressions/"&gt;DEVit'15&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/05/25/devit-conf-2016/"&gt;DEVit'16&lt;/a&gt;
if you are still wondering whether to attend or not! I strongly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;01-02 June - Shift Developer Conference, Split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shift.codeanywhere.com/"&gt;Shift&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a very big event in Croatia.
My attendance is still unconfirmed due to lots of traveling before that and
the general trouble of efficiently traveling on the Balkans. However I have a
CFP submitted and waiting for approval. This time it is my
&lt;em&gt;Mutation Testing in Patterns&lt;/em&gt;, which is a journal of different code patterns
found during mutation testing. I have not yet presented it to the public
but will blog about it sometime soon so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;July - TuxCon, Plovdiv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuxcon.mobi/"&gt;TuxCon&lt;/a&gt; is held in Plovdiv around the beginning of July.
I'm usually presenting some lightning talks there and use the opportunity to
meet with friends and peers outside Sofia and catch up with news from the
local community. The conference is in Bulgarian with the exception of the
occasional foreign speaker. If you understand Bulgarian I recommend the
story of
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/07/12/testing-the-8-bit-computer-puldin/"&gt;Puldin - a Bulgarian computer from the 80s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September or October - SEETEST, The Balkans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://seetest.org"&gt;South East European Software Testing Conference&lt;/a&gt; is, AFAIK,
an international event which is hosted in a major city on the Balkans. Last year it was
held in Bucharest with previous years held in Sofia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view this is the most formal event, especially related to software testing,
I'm about to visit. Nevertheless I like to hear about new ideas and some research
in the field of QA so this is a good opportunity. I'm not planning to speak at
this event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October - HackConf, Sofia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackconf.bg"&gt;HackConf&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest conferences in Bulgaria, gathering
over 1000 people each year. I am strongly affiliated with the people who organize it
and even had the opportunity to host the opening session last year. The picture above
is from this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience is still very young and inexperienced but the presenters are above average.
Organizers' goal is HackConf to become the strongest technical conference in the country
and also serve as a sort of inspiration for young IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year the conference has a topic and I have no idea what the topic for 2017 will be.
In any case I think I will have something interesting to share with the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October - IT Weekend, Bulgaria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://it-weekend.com/"&gt;IT Weekend&lt;/a&gt; is organized by Petar Sabev, the same person who's
behind QA: Challenge Accepted. It is a non-formal gathering of engineers with the intent
to share some news and then discuss and share problems and experiences. Checkout my
review of
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/"&gt;IT Weekend #1&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/02/it-weekend-highlights/"&gt;IT Weekend #3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic revolve around QA, leadership and management but the format is open and the
intention is to broaden the topics covered. The event is held outside Sofia at a SPA
hotel and makes for a very nice retreat. I don't have a topic but I'm definitely going
if time allows. I will probably make something up if we have QA slots available :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October - Software Freedom Kosova, Prishtina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sfk.flossk.org"&gt;Software Freedom Kosova&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest conferences
about free and open source software in the region.
This is part of my goal to explore the IT communities on the Balkans.
Kosovo sounds a bit strange to visit but I did recognize a few names on the speaker
list of previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFP is not open yet but I'm planning to make a presentation. Also if weather
allows I'm planning a road trip on my motorbike :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November - ISTA Con, Sofia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://istacon.org/"&gt;Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation&lt;/a&gt; started as a QA conference
several years ago but it has broaden the range of acceptable topics to include
development, devops and agile. I was at the first two editions and then didn't attend
for a while until &lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/30/highlights-from-ista-and-gtac-2016/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; when I
really liked it. The event is entirely in English with lots of foreign speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been working on something I call "Regression Test Monitoring" and my
intention is to present this at ISTA 2017 so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November - Google Test Automation Conference, London&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no dates announced for
&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/"&gt;GTAC 2017&lt;/a&gt;
but it will be held in London. Both speakers and attendees are pre-approved
and my goal is to be the second Bulgarian to speak at GTAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous two years saw talks about
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/"&gt;mutation testing vs. coverage&lt;/a&gt;
and their respective use
to determine the quality of a test suite with both parties arguing against
each other. Since I'm working in both of these fields and have at least one
practical example I'm trying to gather more information and present my findings
to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and see you around!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>QA &amp; Automation 101 Retrospective</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/29/qa-automation-101-retrospective/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-29T10:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-12-29:blog/2016/12/29/qa-automation-101-retrospective/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="QA 101 graduation" src="/images/qa101_final.jpg" title="QA 101 graduation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this year I've hosted the first QA related course at
&lt;a href="http://hackbulgaria.com/"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. This is a long overdue post about
how the course went, what worked well and what didn't. Brace yourself because
it is going to be a long one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind a QA course has been lurking in both RadoRado's (from HackBulgaria)
and my heads for quite a while. We've been discussing it at least a year before we
actually started. One day Rado told me he'd found a sponsor and we have the go ahead
for the course and that's how it all started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue was that we weren't prepared to start at a moments notice. I literally
had two weeks to prepare
&lt;a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101"&gt;the curriculum&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/04/12/how-to-hire-software-testers-pt-1/"&gt;initial interview questions&lt;/a&gt;.
Next we opened the application form and left it open until the last possible moment.
I've been reviewing candidate answers hours before the course started, which was
another mistake we made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side is that I hosted a
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgu0VTxytYw&amp;amp;index=37&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A session on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;
answering general questions about the profession and the course itself. This
live stream helped popularize the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start we had 30 people and around 13 of them managed to "graduate"
till the final lesson. The biggest portion of students dropped out after the
first 5 lessons of Java crash course! Each lesson was around 4 hours with 20-30
minutes break in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the criteria find a first job or find a new/better job I consider the
training successful. To my knowledge all students have found better jobs, many of them
as software testers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the practical side of things students managed to find and report 11 interesting
bugs against Fedora. Mind you that these were all found in the wild:
&lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/5323"&gt;fedora-infrastructure #5323&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339701"&gt;RHBZ#1339701&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339709"&gt;RHBZ#1339709&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339713"&gt;RHBZ#1339713&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339719"&gt;RHBZ#1339719&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339731"&gt;RHBZ#1339731&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339739"&gt;RHBZ#1339739&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339742"&gt;RHBZ#1339742&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339746"&gt;RHBZ#1339746&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340541"&gt;RHBZ#1340541&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340891"&gt;RHBZ#1340891&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then students also made a few pull requests on GitHub (3 which I know off):
&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-math/pull/38"&gt;commons-math #38&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-csv/pull/12"&gt;commons-csv #12&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-email/pull/1"&gt;commons-email #1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference most lessons were a mix of short presentation about theory and best practices
followed by discussions and where appropriate practical sessions with technology or
projects. The exercises were designed for individual work, work in pairs or small groups (4-5)
on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By request from the sponsors I've tried to keep a detailed record of each student's
performance and personality traits as much as I was able to observe them. I really enjoyed
keeping such a journal but didn't share this info with my students which I consider
a negative issue. I think knowing where your strong and weak areas are would help you
become a better expert in your field!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback from students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was little time (to work on the practical examples I guess);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having particular practical tasks was a problem. For example we didn't have tasks of the
sort do "X" then "Y";&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They needed more time and more attention to be given to them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing different pieces of software and tools took a lot of time and frustration.
It was also quite problematic sometimes depending on whether they used Linux, Windows or Mac OS X;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Eclipse IDE was horrible. Nobody new what to do and the interface
wasn't newbie friendly. Also it took quite a lot of time to install dependencies and/or
import projects to run in Eclipse;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were a few problems with Selenium and its different versions being used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to point out that while these are valid concerns and major issues students were
at least partially guilty for the last 3 of them. It was my impression that most of them
didn't prepare at home, didn't read the next lesson and didn't install prerequisite
tools and software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5x Java Crash Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've started with a Java crash course as requested by our sponsors which was extended to
5 instead of the original 3 sessions. RadoRado was teaching Java fundamentals while
I was assisting him with comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the good side is that Rado explains very well and in much details. He also writes code
to demonstrate what he teaches and while doing so uses only the knowledge he's presented
so far. For example if there's a repeating logic/functionality he would just write it
twice instead of refactoring that into a separate function with parameters (assuming
the students have not learned about functions yet). I think this made it more easier
to understand the concepts being taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another positive thing we did was me going behind Rado's computer and modifying some
of the code while he was explaining something on screen. If you take the above example
and have two methods with print out salutations, e.g. "Good morning, Alex" I would go
and modify one of them to include "Mr." while the other will not. This introduced a
change in behavior which ultimately results in a bug! This was a nice practical way
to demonstrate how some classes of bugs get introduced in reality. We did only a few of
these behind the computer changes and I definitely liked them! They were all ad-hoc,
not planned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side Java seems hard to learn and after these 5 lessons half of the
students dropped out. Maybe part of the reason is they didn't expect to start a QA
course with lessons about programming. But that also means they didn't pay enough
attention to the curriculum, which was announced in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 01 - QA Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made a point to assign time constraints to each exercise in the lessons.
While that mostly worked in the first few lessons, where there is more theory,
we didn't keep the schedule and were overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining testing theory (based on ISTQB fundamentals) took longer than I expected.
it was also evident that we needed more written examples of what different test
analysis techniques are (e.g. boundary value analysis). Here Petar Sabev helped
me deliver few very nice examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises was "when to stop testing" with an example of a Sudoku solving
function and different environments in which this code operates, e.g. browser, mobile,
etc. Students appeared to have a hard time understanding what a
"runtime environment" is and define relevant tests based on that! I believe most
of the students, due to lack of knowledge and experience, were also having a hard time grasping the
concept of non-functional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive thing was that students started explaining to one another and giving
examples for bugs they've seen outside the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 02 - Software Development Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson was designed as role playing game to demonstrate the most common
software development methodologies - waterfall and agile and discuss the QA role
in both of them. The format by itself is very hard to conduct successfully and
this was my first time ever doing this. I've also never taken part of such games
until then, only heard about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the waterfall exercise it was harder for the students to follow the game
constraints and not exchange information with one another because they were sitting
on the same table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side all groups came with unique ideas about software features and how
they want to develop them. Timewise we managed to do very well. On the negative side
is that I was the client for all groups and didn't manage to pay enough attention
to everyone, which btw is what clients usually do in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 03 - Bug Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson was a practical exercise in writing bug reports and figuring out what
information needs to be present in a good bug report. Btw this is something I
always ask junior members at job interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we started with working in pairs to define what a good bug report is
without actually knowing what that means. Students found it hard to brainstorm
together and most of them worked alone during this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next students had to write bug reports for some example bugs, which I've explained briefly
on purpose and perform peer reviews of their bugs. Reviews took a long time to complete
but overall students had a good idea of what information to include in a bug report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after learning from their mistakes and hearing what others had done, they've
learned about some good practices and were tasked to rewrite their bug reports using
the new knowledge. I really like the approach of letting students make some mistakes
and then showing them the easier/better way of doing things. This is also on-par with
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/"&gt;Ivan Nemytchenko's methodology&lt;/a&gt; of
letting his interns learn by their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All bug reports can be found in students repositories, which are forked from the
curriculum. Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network"&gt;https://github.com/HackBulgaria/QA-and-Automation-101/network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have really asked everyone to file bugs under the curriculum repository so
it is easier for me to track them. On the other hand I wanted each student to start building
their own public profile to show potential employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 04 - Test Case Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson started with an exercise asking students to create accounts for
Red Hat's OpenShift cloud platform in the form of a test scenario. The scenario intentionally
left out some details. The idea being that missing information introduces inconsistencies
during testing and to demonstrate how the same steps were performed slightly differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some troubles explaining exactly "how did you test" because most inexperienced people
would not remember all details about where they clicked, did they use the mouse or the
keyboard, was the tab order correct, etc. Regardless students managed to receive different
results and discover that some email providers were not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homework assignment was to create test plans and test cases in Nitrate at
&lt;a href="https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/"&gt;https://nitrate-hackbg.rhcloud.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the system appears to be down ATM
and I don't have time to investigate why. This piece of infrastructure was put together
in 2 hours and I'm surprised it lasted without issues during the entire course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2x Introduction to Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a crash course in Linux fundamentals and exercise with most common commands
and text editors in the console. Most of the students were not prepared with virtual
machines. We've also used a cloud provider to give students remote shell but the
provider API was failing and we had to deploy docker containers manually. Overall
infrastructure was a big problem but we somehow managed. Another problem was with
ssh clients from Windows who generated keys in a format that our cloud provider
couldn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrt commands and exercises students did well and managed to execute most of them
on their own. That's very good for people who've never seen a terminal in their lives
(more or less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 05 - Testing Fedora 24(25) Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again nobody was prepared with a virtual machine with Fedora and students
were installing software as we go. Because of that we didn't manage to conduct
the lesson properly and had to repeat it on the next session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rawhide being the bleeding edge of Fedora means it is full of bugs. Well I couldn't
keep up with everyone and explain workarounds or how to install/upgrade Fedora.
That was a major setback. It also became evident that you can't move quickly
if you have no idea what to do and no instructions about it either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 05 - Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once prepared with the latest and greatest from Rawhide the task was to analyze the
proposed feature changes (on the Fedora wiki) and create test plans and design
test cases for said changes. Then execute the tests in search for bugs. This is where
some of the bugs above came from. The rest were found during upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson was team work (4-5 students) but the results were mixed. IMO Fedora changes
are quite hard to grasp, especially if you lack domain knowledge and broader knowledge
about the structure and operation of a Linux distribution. I don't think most teams
were able to clearly understand their chosen features and successfully create good
plans/scenarios for them. On the other hand in real life software you don't necessarily
understand the domain better and know what to do. I've been in situations where
whole features have been defined by a single sentence and requested to be tested by QA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the teams didn't manage to install Fedora (IIRC they didn't have laptops
capable of running a VM) and were not able to conduct the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to find real life bugs, some of them serious, and getting traction in Bugzilla
is the most positive effect of this lesson. I personally wanted to have more output
(e.g. more bugs, more cases defined, etc) but taking into account the blocking factors
and setbacks I think this is a good initial result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 06 - Unit Testing and Continuous Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we had a few examples of bad stubs and mocks which were not received very well.
The topic is hard in itself and wasn't very well explained with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another negative thing is that students took a lot of time to fiddle around with
Eclipse, they were mistyping commands in the terminal and generally not paying enough
attention to instructions. This caused the exercises to go slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had an exercise which asks the student to write a new test for a non-existing
method. Then implement the method and make sure all the tests passed. You guessed it
this is Test Driven Development.
IIRC one of the students was having a hard time with that exercise so I popped up
my editor on the large screen and started typing what she told me, then re-running the
tests and asking her to show me the errors I've made and tell me how to correct them.
The exercise was received very well and was fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to lack of time we had to go over TravisCI very quickly. The other bad thing about
TravisCI is that it requires git/GitHub and the students were generally inexperienced
with that. Both GitHub for Windows and Mac OS suck a big time IMO. What you need is the
console. However none of the students had any practical experience with git and knew
how to commit code and push branches to GitHub. git fundamentals however is a separate
one or two lessons by itself which we didn't do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 07 - Writing JUnit tests for Apache Commons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the problems with Eclipse and the GitHub desktop client and
missing instructions for Windows the hardest part of this lesson was actually
selecting a component to work on, understanding what the code does and actually
writing meaningful tests. On top of that most students were not very proficient
programmers and Java was completely new to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having 3 pull requests on GitHub I consider this lesson to be a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 08 - Integration Testing with Selenium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson starts with an example of what a flaky test it. At the moment I don't
think this lesson is the best place for that example. To make things even more difficult
the example is in Python (because that way was the easiest for me to write it) instead
of Java. Students had problems installing Python on Windows just to make this example work.
They also were lacking the knowledge how to execute a script in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the students proposed a better flaky example utilizing dates and times and
executing it during various hours of the day. I have yet to code this and
prepare environment in which it would be executed. Btw recently I've seen similar behavior
caused by inconsistent timezone usage in Ruby which resulted in unexpected time offset
a little after midnight :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I have to point out that students came generally unprepared for the lesson
and haven't installed prerequisite software and programming languages. This is becoming
a trend and needs to be split out into a preparation session, possibly with a check
list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Selenium side, starting with Selenium IDE, it was a bit unclear how to use it
and what needs to be done. This is another negative trend, where students were missing clear
instructions what they are expected to do. At the end we did resort to live demo
using Selenium IDE so they can at least get some idea about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 09 and 10 - Writing Selenium tests for Mozilla Add-ons website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMO these two lessons are the biggest disaster of the entire course. Python &amp;amp; virtualenv
on Windows was a total no go but on Linux things weren't much easier because students
had no idea what a virtualenv is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice wise they haven't managed to read all the bugs on the Mozilla bug tracker and
had a very hard time selecting bugs to write tests for. Not to mention that many of the
reported bugs were administrative tasks to create or remove add-on categories. There
weren't many functional related bugs to write tests for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product under test was also hard to understand and most students were seeing it for the first
time, let alone getting to know the devel and testing environments that Mozilla provides.
Mozilla's test suite being in Python is just another issue to make contribution harder
because we've never actually studied Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the two lessons there were students who've missed the Selenium introduction
lesson and were having even harder time to figure things out. I didn't have the time
to explain and go back to the previous lesson for them.
Maybe an attendance policy is needed for dependent lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the course started I've talked to some guys at Mozilla's IRC channel and
they agreed to help but at the end we didn't even engage with them. At this point
I'm skeptical that mentoring over IRC would have worked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 11 - Introduction to Performance Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a more theoretical lesson with less practical examples and exercises.
I have provided some blog posts of mine related to the topic of performance
testing but in general they are related to software that I've used which isn't
generally known to a less experienced audience (Celery, Twisted). These blog posts
IMO were hard to put into perspective and didn't serve a good purpose as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical part of the lesson was a discussion with the goal of creating a
performance testing strategy for GitHub's infrastructure. It was me who was
doing most of the talking because students have no experience working on such
a large infrastructure like GitHub and didn't know what components might be
there, how they might be organized (load balancers, fail overs, etc)
and what needs to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a more practical example to create a performance test in Java for
one of the classes found in &lt;code&gt;commons-codec/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/digest&lt;/code&gt;.
Again the main difficulty here was working fluently with Eclipse, getting the projects to
build/run and knowing how the software under test was supposed to work and be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 12 - How to find 1000 bugs in 30 minutes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a more relaxed lesson with examples of simple types of bugs found on a
large scale. Most examples came from my blog and experiments I've made against
Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While amusing and fun I don't think all of the students understood me and kept
their attention. Part of that is because Fedora tends to focus on low level
stuff and my examples were not necessarily easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback from the sponsor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experian Bulgaria was the exclusive sponsor for this course. At the end of the summer
Rado and I met with them to discuss the results of the training. Here's what they say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall technical knowledge they consider to be weak. What they need are people
with basic knowledge in the field of object oriented programming, databases, operating
systems and networking. These are skills candidates need in order to work for Experian.
It must be noted that most of them were not taught at this course!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English language proficiency for all students is low on average;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User level experience with Linux was fine but students were missing deeper
knowledge about the operating system. Once again something we didn't teach;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The programming languages favored at Experian are Java and Ruby and students
had poor knowledge of them. They also had weak understanding of OOP principles;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Experian students were more ingrained with the development mindset
and were trying their luck in the QA profession instead of genuinely being interested
in the field. While this is generally the case I have to point out that as sponsor
Experian did a poor job at promoting their company and the QA profession
as a whole. What isn't known to the general public is their big in-house
QA community which could have served as a source of inspiration for the students!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low motivation and lack of fundamental knowledge from university are other
traits interviewers at Experian have identified. They argued for a stronger
acceptance process and a requirement of minimum 2 years of university
education in computer science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of testing knowledge candidates did mostly OK, however
we don't have enough information about this. Also the hiring process at
Experian is more focused on the broader knowledge areas listed above so
substantial improvement in the testing knowledge of candidates doesn't given
them much head start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While to my knowledge they didn't hire anyone few people
received an offer but declined due to various personal reasons. I view this
as poor performance on our side but Experian thinks otherwise and are willing
to sponsor another round of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of all the things that could be improved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to develop the curriculum and have it pass QA review by other
experienced testers (in particular such that also teach students);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the application process harder to include people with broader IT knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow time to review all applicants;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a co-trainer and additional mentors for some of the exercises;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize the number of students accepted in the course so we can handle everyone
with more care;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give homework assignments and examine them before each lesson;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and provide performance review at the end of the course;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize the technology stack and tools used;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host a technology preparation session at the beginning paired
with a check list of all the things that need to be done. Very likely
make the chosen technology stack a hard requirement to avoid setbacks
later in the schedule;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need more fundamental lessons like practical git tutorial,
practical Linux tutorial, databases, networking, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same goes for Java or any other programming language. Each of these technologies
easily makes a course by itself. Possibly include technology skill assessment
in the application form and reject candidates who don't meet the minimum level.
This is to ensure the group is able to move at the same pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to improve the infrastructure used during the course,
especially exercise bug tracking and test case management systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students need clear instructions for every exercise - what is required from them,
what the expected result is and what they need to be doing, etc;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide more examples for just about everything. Also make the examples
easier to understand/simple with the harder examples left for further
reading;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide easier projects to work on. This means applications whose domain
is easier to understand and closer to what experiences the students might have.
Also projects need clear instructions how to join and how to contribute with tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same application/software needs to be used for manual bug finding,
unit test writing and integration test with Selenium. This will minimize
both context and technology switches and allow to view various testing
activities in the context of a single software under test;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While using open source projects for the above listed purposes sounds great
the reality is that they are hard to join and will not move according to our
schedule. Maybe less focus on open source per-se and more focus on a particular
application under test. Instructors can then proxy all the tests forward
to the upstream community;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus more on practice and less on exotic topics like performance testing
and large scale bug finding;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek more active participation from sponsors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions please comment below, especially if you can tell me
how to implement them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category></entry><entry><title>4 Quick Wins to Manage the Cost of Software Testing</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/28/4-quick-wins-to-manage-the-cost-of-software-testing/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-28T11:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-12-28:blog/2016/12/28/4-quick-wins-to-manage-the-cost-of-software-testing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Every activity in software development has a cost and a value. Getting cost to
trend down while increasing value, is the ultimate goal.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the introduction of an e-book called
&lt;a href="http://pi.qasymphony.com/four-quick-wins-thank-you"&gt;4 Quick Wins to Manage the Cost of Software Testing&lt;/a&gt;.
It was sent to me by Ivan Fingarov couple of months ago. Just now I've managed to
read it and here's a quick summary. I urge everyone to download the original copy
and give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses on several practices which organizations can apply immediately
in order to become more efficient and transparent in their software testing. While
larger organizations (e.g. enterprises) have most of these practices already in place
smaller companies (up to 50-100 engineering staff) may not be familiar with them
and will reap the most benefits of implementing said practices. Even though I work
for a large enterprise I find this guide useful when considered at the individual
team level!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter focuses on &lt;em&gt;Tactics&lt;/em&gt; to minimize cost: Process, Tools, Bug System Mining
and Eliminating Handoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Process&lt;/em&gt; the goal is to minimize the burden of documenting the test process
(aka testing artifacts), allow for better transparency and visibility outside the QA group
and streamline the decision making process of what to test and when to stop testing,
how much has been tested, what the risk is, ect. The authors propose testing core functionality
paired with emerging risk areas based on new features development. They propose making
a list of these and sorting that list by perceived risk/priority and testing as much
as possible. Indeed this is very similar to the method I've used at Red Hat when designing
testing for new features and new major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. A similar
method I've seen in place at several start-ups as well, although in the small organization
the primary driver for this method is lack of sufficient test resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt; proposes the use of test case management systems to ease the documentation burden.
I've used &lt;a href="http://testlink.org/"&gt;TestLink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate"&gt;Nitrate&lt;/a&gt;.
From them Nitrate has more features but is currently unmaintained with me being the
largest contributor on GitHub. From the paid variants I've used
&lt;a href="https://www.polarion.com/products/qa/test-automation"&gt;Polarion&lt;/a&gt; which I generally dislike.
Polarion is most suitable for large organizations because it gives lots of opportunities
for tracking and reporting. For small organizations it is an overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bug System Mining&lt;/em&gt; is a technique which involves regularly scanning the bug tracker
and searching for patterns. This is useful for finding bug types which appear
frequently and generally point to a flaw in the software development process. The fix for these
flaws usually is a change in policy/workflow which eliminates the source of the errors.
I'm a fan of this technique when joining an existing project and need to assess
what the current state is. I've done this when consulting for a few start-ups, including
&lt;a href="http://meet.jit.si"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt; (acquired by Atlassian), however I'm not doing bug mining
on a regular basis which I consider a drawback and I really should start doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example at one project I found lots of bugs reported against translations, e.g.
missing translations, text overflowing the visible screen area or not playing well with
existing design, chosen language/style not fitting well with the product domain, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the problem was how the software in question has been localized.
The translators were given a file of English strings, which they would translate and
return back in an spread sheet. Developers would copy&amp;amp;paste the translated strings
into localization files and integrate with the software. Then QA would usually
inspect all the pages and report the above issues. The solution was to remove devel
and QA from the translation process, implement a translation management system together
with live preview (web based) so that translators can keep track of what is left to
translate and can visually inspect their work immediately after a string was translated.
Thus translators are given more context for their work but also given the responsibility
to produce good quality translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example I've seen are many bugs which seem like a follow up/nice to have features
of partially implemented functionality. The root cause of this problem turned out to be
that devel was jumping straight to implementation without taking the time to brainstorm
and consult with QE and product owners, not taking into account corner cases and minor
issues which would have easily been raised by skillful testers. This process lead to
several iterations until the said functionality was considered initially implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eliminating Handoffs&lt;/em&gt; proposes the use of cross-functional teams to reduce idle time
and reduce the back-and-forth communication which happens when a bug is found, reported,
evaluated and considered for a fix, fixed by devel and finally deployed for testing.
This method argues that including testers early in the process and pairing them with
the devel team will produce faster bug fixes and reduce communication burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I generally agree with that statement it's worth noting that cross-functional
teams perform really well when all team members have relatively equal skill level
on the horizontal scale and strong experience on the vertical scale (think T-shaped specialist).
Cross-functional teams
don't work well when you have developers who aren't well versed in the testing domain
and/or testers who are not well versed in programming or the broader OS/computer science
fundamentals domain. In my opinion you need well experienced engineers for a good cross-functional
team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chapter &lt;em&gt;Collaboration&lt;/em&gt; the paper focuses on pairing, building the right thing
and faster feedback loops for developers. This overlaps with earlier proposals for
cross-functional teams and QA bringing value by asking the "what if" questions.
The chapter specifically talks about the Three Amigos meeting between PM, devel and QA
where they discuss a feature proposal from all angles and finally come to a conclusion
what the feature should look like. I'm a strong supporter of this technique and have
been working with it under one form or another during my entire career. This also
touches on the notion that testers need to move into the &lt;em&gt;Quality Assistance&lt;/em&gt; business
and be proactive during the software development process, which is something I'm
hoping to talk about at the
&lt;a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro/"&gt;Romanian Testing Conference&lt;/a&gt; next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the book talks about &lt;em&gt;Skills Development&lt;/em&gt; and makes the distinction between
Centers of Excellence (CoE) and Communities of Practice (CoP). Both the book and I
are supporters of the CoP approach. This is a bottoms-up approach which is open for
everyone to join in and harnesses the team creative abilities. It also takes into
account that different teams use different methods and tools and that
"one size doesn't fit all"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Skilled teams find important bugs faster, discover innovative solutions to hard
testing problems and know how to communicate their value. Sometimes, a few super
testers can replace an army of average testers.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While I consider myself to be a "super tester" with thousands of bugs reported there
is a very important note to make here. Communities of Practice are successful when
their members are self-focused on skill development! In my view and to some
extent the communities I've worked with everyone should strive to constantly improve
their skills but also exercise peer pressure on their co-workers to not fall behind.
This has been confirmed by other folks in the QA industry and I've heard it many times
when talking to friends from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category></entry><entry><title>Mutation Testing vs. Coverage</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-27T11:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-12-27:blog/2016/12/27/mutation-testing-vs-coverage/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At GTAC 2015 Laura Inozemtseva made a lightning talk titled
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=47"&gt;Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;
which is the single event that got me hooked up with mutation testing.
This year, at GTAC 2016, Rahul Gopinath made a counter argument
with his lightning talk
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEptA3KP08&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test Suite Effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.
So which one is better ? I urge you to watch both talks and take notes before
reading about my practical experiment and other opinions on the topic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic-Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python
so my view is biased!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Laura and Rahul (you will too) agree that a test suite effectiveness depends
on the strength of its oracles. In other words the assertions you make in your tests.
This is what makes a test suite good and determines its ability to detect bugs when
present. I've decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab"&gt;pelican-ab&lt;/a&gt; as
a practical example. pelican-ab is a plugin for Pelican, the static site generator
for Python. It allows you to generate A/B experiments by writing out the content
into different directories and adjusting URL paths based on the experiment name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can 100% code coverage detect bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;! In version 0.2.1,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ef1e2117ad8ffa5b9fa8470d32d54a36ccb140bb"&gt;commit ef1e211&lt;/a&gt;,
pelican-ab had the following bug:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;several&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;experiments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;control&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;regenerate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;regenerate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;xy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;regenerate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;publish&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Actual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;xy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;experiment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;would&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;published&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;online&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;experiments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;under&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is because before each invocation Pelican deletes the output directory and
re-creates the entire content structure. The bug was not caught regardless of
having 100% line + branch coverage. See
&lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/129514715"&gt;Build #10&lt;/a&gt; for more
info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can 100% mutation coverage detect bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've branched off since commit ef1e211 into the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commits/mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment"&gt;mutation_testing_vs_coverage_experiment branch&lt;/a&gt;
(requires Pelican==3.6.3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initial execution of Cosmic Ray I have 2 mutants left:&lt;/p&gt;

survival rate: 6.06%
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last one, job 33 is equivalent mutation. The first one, job 29 is killed by the test
added in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/b8bff85eeca6c18fbf62cac55fd1a0d64295c43c"&gt;commit b8bff85&lt;/a&gt;.
For all practical purposes we now have 100% code coverage and 100% mutation coverage.
The bug described above still exists thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can we detect the bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug isn't detected by any test because
we don't have tests designed to perform and validate the exact same steps that a
physical person will execute when using pelican-ab. Such test is added in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/ca85bd042d783f2f6551ae17f16b29aa3750711b"&gt;commit ca85bd0&lt;/a&gt;
and you can see that it causes
&lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/MrSenko/pelican-ab/builds/186510356"&gt;Build #22&lt;/a&gt; to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment with setting &lt;code&gt;DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=False&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;tests/pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and
the test will PASS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is pelican-ab bug free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not of course. Even after 100% code and mutation coverage and after manually constructing
a test which mimics user behavior there is at least one more bug present. There
is a pylint &lt;code&gt;bad-super-call&lt;/code&gt; error, fixed in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/MrSenko/pelican-ab/commit/193e3db9e7d021e11b54f54ac8b8718651c633c8"&gt;commit 193e3db&lt;/a&gt;.
For more information about the error see
&lt;a href="http://mrsenko.com/blog/atodorov/2016/09/14/beware-of-recursion-loop-when-using-super/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other bugs found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my humble experience with mutation testing so far I've added
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pulls/atodorov"&gt;quite a few new tests&lt;/a&gt;
and discovered two bugs which went unnoticed for years. The first one is
constructor parameter not passed to parent constructor,
see
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-f4294048719aeac4da7a86eee0fbdfd3"&gt;PR#96, pykickstart/commands/authconfig.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        KickstartCommand.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/span&gt;
         self.authconfig = kwargs.get(&amp;quot;authconfig&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second bug is parameter being passed to parent class constructor,
but the parent class doesn't care about this parameter. For example
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rhinstaller/pykickstart/pull/96/files#diff-7d2833450b6e1c9a94eb90e7f171ff52"&gt;PR#96, pykickstart/commands/driverdisk.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-    def __init__(self, writePriority=0, *args, **kwargs):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-        BaseData.__init__(self, writePriority, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+        BaseData.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also note that pykickstart has nearly 100% test coverage as a whole
and the affected files were 100% covered as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bugs above don't seem like a big deal and when considered out of context
are relatively minor. However pykickstart's biggest client is anaconda, the Fedora
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program. Anaconda uses pykickstart to
parse and generate text files (called kickstart files) which contain information
for driving the installation in a fully automated manner. This is used by everyone
who installs Linux on a large scale and is pretty important functionality!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;writePriority&lt;/code&gt; controls the order of which individual commands are written to file
at the end of the installation. In rare cases the order of commands may depend
on each other. Now imagine the bugs above produce a disordered kickstart file,
which a system administrator thinks should work but it doesn't. It may be the case
this administrator is trying to provision hundreds of Linux systems to bootstrap
a new data center or maybe performing disaster recovery. You get the scale of
the problem now, don't you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I've seen bugs of this nature but not in the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all to say a minor change like this may have
an unexpectedly big impact somewhere down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the above findings and my bias I'll say the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither 100% coverage, nor 100% mutation coverage are a silver bullet against bugs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% mutation coverage appears to be better than 100% code coverage in practice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutation testing clearly shows out pieces of code which need refactoring
  which in turn minimizes the number of possible mutations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutation testing causes you to write more asserts and construct more detailed tests
  which is always a good thing when testing software;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't replace humans designing test cases just yet but can give them tools
  to allow them to write more and better tests;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should not rely on a single tool (or two of them) because tools are only
  able to find bugs they were designed for!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: What others think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus to this article let me share a transcript from the
&lt;a href="https://mutation-testing.slack.com"&gt;mutation-testing.slack.com&lt;/a&gt; community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;atodorov 2:28 PM
Hello everyone, I&amp;#39;d like to kick-off a discussion / interested in what you think about
Rahul Gopinath&amp;#39;s talk at GTAC this year. What he argues is that test coverage is still
the best metric for how good a test suite is and that mutation coverage doesn&amp;#39;t add much
additional value. His talk is basically the opposite of what @lminozem presented last year
at GTAC. Obviously the community here and especially tools authors will have an opinion on
these two presentations.

@atodorov I have had the &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot; of working on a couple projects lately that illustrate
why LOC test coverage is a misnomer. I am a **strong** proponent of mutation testing so will
declare my bias.

The projects I have worked on have had a mix of test coverage - one about 50% and
another &amp;gt; 90%.

In both cases however there was a significant difference IMO relative to mutation coverage
(which I have more faith in as representative of true tested code).

Critical factors I see when I look at the difference:

- Line length: in both projects the line lengths FAR exceeded visible line lengths that are
&amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot;. Many LONGER lines had inline conditionals at the end, or had ternary operators
and therefore were in fact only 50% or not at all covered, but were &amp;quot;traversed&amp;quot;

- Code Conviction (my term): Most of the code in these projects (Rails applications) had
significant Hash references all of which were declared in &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; format hhh[:symbol].
So it was nearly impossible for the code in execution to confirm the expectation of the
existence of a hash entry as would be the case with stronger code such as &amp;quot;hhh.fetch(:symbol)&amp;quot;

- Instance variables abound: As with most of Rails code the number of instance variables
in a controller are extreme. This pattern of reference leaked into all other code as well,
making it nearly impossible with the complex code flow to ascertain proper reference
patterns that ensured the use of the instance variables, so there were numerous cases
of instance variable typos that went unnoticed for years. (edited)

- .save and .update: yes again a Rails issue, but use of these &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot; operations showed again
that although they were traversed, in many cases those method references could be removed
during mutation and the tests would still pass - a clear indication that save or update was
silently failing.

I could go on and on, but the mere traversal of a line of code in Ruby is far from an indication
of anything more than it may be &amp;quot;typed in correctly&amp;quot;.

@atodorov Hope that helps.

LOC test coverage is a place to begin - NOT a place to end.

@tjchambers: thanks for your answer. It&amp;#39;s too late for me here to read it carefully but
I&amp;#39;ll do it tomorrow and ping you back

dkubb 1:13 AM
As a practice mutation testing is less widely used. The tooling is still maturing. Depending on your
language and environment you might have widely different experiences with mutation testing

I have not watched the video, but it is conceivable that someone could try out mutation testing tools
for their language and conclude it doesn’t add very much

mbj 1:14 AM
Yeah, I recall talking with @lminozem here and we identified that the tools she used likely
show high rates of false positives / false coverage (as the tools likely do not protect against
certain types of integration errors)

dkubb 1:15 AM
IME, having done TDD for about 15+ years or so, and mutation testing for about 6 years, I think
when it is done well it can be far superior to using line coverage as a measurement of test quality

mbj 1:16 AM
Any talk pro/against mutation testing must, as the tool basis is not very homogeneous, show a non consistent result.

dkubb 1:16 AM
Like @tjchambers says though, if you have really poor line coverage you’re not going to
get as much of a benefit from mutation testing, since it’s going to be telling you what
you already know — that your project is poorly tested and lots of code is never exercised

mbj 1:19 AM
Thats a good and likely the core point. I consider that mutation testing only makes sense
when aiming for 100% (and this is to my experience not impractical).

tjchambers 1:20 AM
I don&amp;#39;t discount the fact that tool quality in any endeavor can bring pro/con judgements
based on particular outcomes

dkubb 1:20 AM
What is really interesting for people is to get to 100% line coverage, and then try mutation
testing. You think you’ve done a good job, but I guarantee mutation testing will find dozens
if not hundreds of untested cases .. even in something with 100% line coverage

To properly evaluate mutation testing, I think this process is required, because you can’t
truly understand how little line coverage gives you in comparison

tjchambers 1:22 AM
But I don&amp;#39;t need a tool to tell me that a 250 character line of conditional code that by
itself would be an oversized method AND counts more because there are fewer lines in the
overall percentage contributes to a very foggy sense of coverage.

dkubb 1:22 AM
It would not be unusual for something with 100% line coverage to undergo mutation testing
and actually find out that the tests only kill 60-70% of possible mutations

tjchambers 1:22 AM
@dkubb or less

dkubb 1:23 AM
usually much less :stuck_out_tongue:

it can be really humbling

mbj 1:23 AM
In this discussion you miss that many test suites (unless you have noop detection):
Will show false coverage.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
When I started with mutant on my own project which I developed I had 95% LOC coverage

mbj 1:23 AM
Test suites need to be fixed to comply to mutation testing invariants.

tjchambers 1:23 AM
I had 34% mutation coverage

And that was ignoring the 5% that wasn&amp;#39;t covered at all

mbj 1:24 AM
Also if the tool you compare MT with line coverage on: Is not very strong,
the improvement may not be visible.

dkubb 1:24 AM
another nice benefit is that you will become much better at enumerating all
the things you need to do when writing tests

tjchambers 1:24 AM
@dkubb or better yet - when writing code.

The way I look at it - the fewer the alive mutations the better the test,
the fewer the mutations the better the code.

dkubb 1:29 AM
yeah, you can infer a kind of cyclomatic complexity by looking at how many mutations there are

tjchambers 1:31 AM
Even without tests (not recommended) you can judge a lot from the mutations themselves.

I still am an advocate for mutations/LOC metric
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see members in the community are strong supporters of mutation testing, all of them
having much more experience than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help me collect more practical examples! My goal is to
collect enough information and present the findings at
&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/"&gt;GTAC 2017&lt;/a&gt;
which will be held in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Travis-CI when you combine the three main configuration options of
&lt;em&gt;Runtime (language)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Environment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Exclusions/Inclusions&lt;/em&gt; you get a
&lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Build-Matrix"&gt;build matrix&lt;/a&gt;
of all possible combinations! For example, for &lt;em&gt;django-chartit&lt;/em&gt; the matrix includes
43 build jobs, spread across various Python and Django versions. For reference
see &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/chartit/django-chartit/builds/181115880"&gt;Build #75&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;django-chartit&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to have an additional build job which would execute
pylint. I wanted the job to be independent because currently pylint produces lots
of errors and warnings. Having an independent job instead of integrating pylint
together with all jobs makes it easier to see if any of the functional tests failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the inclusion functionality of Travis-CI I was able to define an auxiliary
build job. The trick is to provide sane environment defaults for all
build jobs (regular and auxiliary ones) so you don't have to expand your environment
section! In this case the change looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/.travis.yml b/.travis.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;index 67f656d..9b669f9 100644&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling for &lt;code&gt;vm_call_cfunc - cfp consistency error&lt;/code&gt; yields
&lt;a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10460"&gt;Ruby #10460&lt;/a&gt;. Comments on the bug and
particularly this one point towards the error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;gt; Ruby is trying to be nice about reporting the error; but in the end,
&amp;gt; your code is still broken if it overflows stack.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the test suite was a piece of code that was overflowing the stack.
It was somewhere along the lines of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;#active_client_for_user&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;matching an existing user&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it_behaves_like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;manager authentication&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;include_examples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;active client for user with existing user&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Considering the examples in the bug I started looking for patterns where a variable
was defined and later redefined, possibly circling back to the previous definition.
Expanding the shared examples by hand transformed the code into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt; 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api_user_authentication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;with an `active_assigned_client`&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;skip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;skip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line 5. overrode line 3. When line 4. was executed first because of lazy execution
and the call execution path became: 4-5-4-5-4-5 ... &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we need a
warning about that in RuboCop, see
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/3769"&gt;RuboCop #3769&lt;/a&gt;.
The fix however is a no brainer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-  let(:user) { create(:user, :manager) }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-  let!(:api_user_authentication) { create(:user_authentication, user: user) }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+  let(:manager) { create(:user, :manager) }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+  let!(:api_user_authentication) { create(:user_authentication, user: manager) }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another two weeks have passed and I'm blogging about another 2 conferences.
This year both
&lt;a href="https://istacon.org/"&gt;Innovations in Software Technologies and Automation&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2016/"&gt;Google Test Automation Conference&lt;/a&gt;
happened on the same day. I was attending ISTA in Sofia during the day and
watching the live stream of GTAC during the evenings. Here are some of the things
that reflected on me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I build my software in order to make this a perfect day for the user ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are not the problem which causes bad software to exist. When designing
software focus on what people need not on what technology is forcing them to do;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to have blind trust in the people you work with because all the times
projects look like they are not going to work until the very end!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's good to have diverse set of characters in the company and not homogenize people;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team performance grows over time. Effective teams minimize time waste
during bad periods. They (have and) extract value from conflicts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-on-one meetings are usually like status reports which is bad. Both parties
should bring their own issues to the table;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To grow an effective team members need to do things together. For example
pair programming, writing test scenarios, etc;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When teams don't take actions after retrospective meetings it is usually a 
sign of missing foundational trust;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QA engineers need to be present at every step of the software development
life-cycle! This is something I teach my students and have been confirmed by
many friends in the industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile is all about data, even when it comes to testing and quality. We need to
decompose and measure iteratively;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile is also about really skillful people. One way to boost your skills is to
adopt the T-shaped specialist model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In agile iterative work and continuous delivery is king so QA engineers need to focus
even more on visualization (I will also add documentation), refactoring and code reviews;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agile teams need to give opportunities to team members for taking risk and taking
ownership of their actions in the gray zone (e.g. actions which isn't clear who should
be doing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brave new world of micro services end to end testing is no more! We test each level
in isolation but keep stable contracts/APIs between levels. That way we can reduce
the test burden and still guarantee an acceptable level of risk. This change in
software architecture (monolithic vs. micro) leads to change in technologies (one framework/language
vs. what's best for the task) which in turn leads to changes in testing approach and
testing tools. This ultimately leads to changing people on the team because they now
need different skills than when they were hired! This circles back to the T-shaped
specialist model and the fact that QA should be integrated in every step of the way!
Thanks to Denitsa Evtimova and Lyudmila Labova for this wisdom and the quote pictured
above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aneta Petkova talked about monitoring of test results which is a topic very close to my work.
Imagine you have your automated test suite but still get failures occasionally. Are these
bugs or something else broke ? If they are bugs and you are waiting for them to be fixed
do you execute the tests against the still broken build or wait ? If you do, what additional info
do you get from these executions vs. how much time do you spend figuring out
"oh, that's still not fixed or geez, here's another hidden bug in the code" ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her team has modified their test execution framework (what I'd usually call a test runner
or even test lab) to have knowledge about issues in JIRA and skip some tests
when no meaningful information can be extracted from them. I have to point out that this
approach may require a lot of maintenance in environments where you have failures due to
infrastructure issues. This idea connects very nicely
with the general idea behind this year's GTAC - don't run tests if you don't need to aka
smart test execution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=2h54m0s"&gt;Boris Prikhodskiy&lt;/a&gt;
shared a very simple rule. Don't execute tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which have 100 % pass rate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the last month;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and have been executed at least 100 times before that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Unity does for their numerous topic branches and reduces test time
with 60-70 percent. All of the test suite is still executed against their trunk branch
and PR merge queue branches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At GTAC there were several presentations about speeding up test execution time.
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=3h18m25s"&gt;Emanuil Slavov&lt;/a&gt; was very practical
but the most important thing he said was that a fast test suite is the result of many
conscious actions which introduced small improvements over time. His team had assigned
themselves the task to iteratively improve their test suite performance and at every step
of the way they analyzed the existing bottlenecks and experimented with possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps in particular are (on a single machine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute tests in dedicated environment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with empty database, not used by anything else; This also leads to
adjustments in your test suite architecture and DB setup procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate and stub external dependencies like 3rd party services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to containers but beware of slow disk I/O;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run database in memory not on disk because it is a temporary DB anyway;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't clean test data, just trash the entire DB once you're done;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute tests in parallel which should be the last thing to do!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equalize workload between parallel threads for optimal performance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade the hardware (RAM, CPU) aka vertical scaling;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add horizontal scaling (probably with a messaging layer);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yN53k9jz3U#t=6h38m7s"&gt;John Micco and Atif Memon&lt;/a&gt;
talked about flaky tests at Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;84% of the transitions from PASS to FAIL are flakes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost 16% of their 3.5 million tests have some level of flakiness;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flaky failures frequently block and delay releases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google spends between 2% and 16% of their CI compute resources
re-running flaky tests;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flakiness insertion speed is comparable to flakiness removal speed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The optimal setting is 2 persons modifying the same source file at the same time.
This leads to minimal chance of breaking stuff;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix or delete flaky tests because you don't get meaningful value out of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Google want to stop a test execution before it is executed if historical
data shows that the test has attributes of flakiness. The research they talk
about utilizes tons of data collected from Google's CI environment which was
the most interesting fact for me. Indeed if we use data to decide which features
to build for our customers then why not use data to govern the process of testing?
In addition to the video you should read John's post
&lt;a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/05/flaky-tests-at-google-and-how-we.html"&gt;Flaky Tests at Google and How We Mitigate Them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end I'd like to finish with 
Rahul Gopinath's
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbocBqOpuAo#t=4h57m30s"&gt;Code Coverage is a Strong Predictor of Test suite Effectiveness in the Real World&lt;/a&gt;.
He basically said that code coverage metrics as we know them today are still
the best practical indicator of how good a test suite is. He argues that mutation testing is slow
and only provides additional 4% to a well designed test suite. This is absolutely the opposite of
what Laura Inozemtseva presented last year in her
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfROROGujU&amp;amp;list=PLSIUOFhnxEiCWGsN9t5A-XOhRbmz54IS1&amp;amp;index=25"&gt;Coverage is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;
lightning talk. Rahul also made a point about sample size in the two research papers
and I had the impression he's saying Laura didn't do a proper academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a heavy contributor to Cosmic Ray, the mutation testing tool for Python and also use
mutation testing in my daily job so this is a very interesting topic indeed. I've asked
fellow tool authors to have a look at both presentations and share their opinions.
I also have an idea about a practical experiment to see if full branch coverage and
full mutation coverage will be able to find a known bug in a piece of software
I wrote. I will be writing about this experiment next week so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been 2 weeks after &lt;a href="http://openfest.org"&gt;OpenFest 2016&lt;/a&gt; and I've promised
to blog about what happened during the &lt;em&gt;Women in Open Source&lt;/em&gt; presentation, which
is the only single talk I did attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenters were Jona Azizaj, whom I met at FOSDEM
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/02/02/fosdem-2016-report/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;,
Suela Palushi and Kristi Progri, all 3 from Albania. I've went to OpenFest
specifically to meet them and listen to their presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started by explaining
their background and telling us more about their respective communities,
&lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Women"&gt;Fedora Women&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://womoz.org"&gt;WoMoz&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/"&gt;GNOME Outreach&lt;/a&gt; and the 
&lt;a href="https://openlabs.cc/"&gt;Open Labs&lt;/a&gt; hackerspace in Tirana.
The girls gave some stats how many women there are in the larger FOSS
community and what some newcomer's first impressions could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know that in 2002 1.1% of all FOSS participants were female, while in
2013 that was 11% ? A 10x increase but of them only 1.5% are developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation was a nice overview of different opportunities
to get involved in open source geared towards women. I've specifically asked and
the girls responded how they first came to join open source. In general they've
had a good and welcoming community around them which made it natural to
join and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the sad part. Instead of welcoming and supporting these girls that they've
stood up to talk about their experiences the audience did the opposite. In particular
&lt;a href="http://plushiegames.com/"&gt;Maya Milusheva from Plushie Games&lt;/a&gt; made a very passionate claim
against the topic women in tech. It went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a good developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a mother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a CEO of a successful IT company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when I hire I want the best people for my company and they are men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;women simply don't have the required tech skills/level of expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole talk about women in open source/diversity is bullshit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;girls need to sit down on their asses and read more, code more, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of successfullness I think I can compare to Maya. I also have a small
child, which I regularly take to conferences with me (the badges above).
I also have an IT company
which generates a comparable amount of income. I also want to hire the best employees
for any given project I'm working on. Sometimes it's happened that to be a woman,
sometimes not. The point here however was not about hiring more women per se. It
was about giving opportunities in the communities and letting people grow for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Yes, she has a point but there's something WRONG in coming to listen to a presenter
just to tell them they are full of shit! It's
very arrogant shouting around and arguing a point about hiring when in fact the
entire presentation was not about hiring!
It is totally unacceptable,
The NY Times writing about apps you develop and behaving like an asshole at public events at
the same time!
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been there, the crowd telling me I'm full of shit when I've been presenting about
new technologies. I've been there being told that my ideas will not work in this or that
way, while in fact the very idea of trying and considering a completely different
technological approach was what counted. And finally I've been there years later when
the same ideas and technologies have become mainstream and the same crowd was now talking
about them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Maya there was another person who grabbed the microphone and continued to talk nonsense.
Unfortunately he didn't state his name and I don't know the guy in person. What he said was
along the lines of &lt;em&gt;little boys play with robots, little girls play with dolls. They like it
this way and that's why girls don't get involved in the technical field. Also if a girl
played with robots she will be called a tomboy and generally have a negative attitude
towards her&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely clear this guy has no idea what he's talking about.
Everyone who has small children around them
will agree that they are born with equal mental capacity. It is up to the
environment, parents, teachers, etc to shape this capacity in a positive way. I've
seen children who taught themselves speaking English from YouTube and children the
same age barely speaking Bulgarian. I've seen children who are curious about the world
and how it works and children who can't wipe their own noses. It's not because they
like it that way, it's because of their parents and the environment they live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I'd like to respond to this guy (I was specifically motioned at the conference
not to respond) with this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
I have a 5 year old girl. She likes robots as much as she likes dolls. She works with Linux
and is lucky enough to have one of the two OLPCs laptops in Bulgaria. She plays
SuperTux and has already found a bug in it (I've reported it). She's been to several
Linux and IT conferences as you can see from the picture above.
She likes being taken to hackathons and learning about inspiring stuff that students are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you telling me that because we have the wrong idea women can't be good at technology
she can't become a successful engineer ? Are you telling me to basically scratch the next 10 years
of her life and tell her she can't become what she wants ? Because if you do I say FUCK OFF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even I as a parent don't have the power to tell my child what they can do or not do,
what they can accomplish or not. My job is to show them the various possibilities that
exist and guide and support them along they way they want to go! This is what we as society
also need to do for everyone else!
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up I will tell you about a psychological experiment we devised with Jona and Suela.
I've proposed
to find a male and female student in Tirana and have them pose online as somebody from the opposite
sex, fake accounts and all. They've proposed having the same person both act as male or female
for the purposes of evening out the tech skills difference.
The goal is to see how does the tech community react to their contributions and try to measure
how much does their gender being known affect their performance! I hope the girls will
find a way to perform this experiment together with the university Psychology department
and share the results with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw I will be visiting
&lt;a href="http://oscal.openlabs.cc/"&gt;OSCAL'17&lt;/a&gt; to check up on that so see you in Albania!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="fedora.planet"></category></entry><entry><title>IT Weekend Highlights</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/11/02/it-weekend-highlights/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-11-02T09:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-11-02:blog/2016/11/02/it-weekend-highlights/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend_cake.jpg" title="IT Weekend" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I attended the third &lt;a href="http://it-weekend.com"&gt;IT Weekend&lt;/a&gt;.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. While during the
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/"&gt;first week&lt;/a&gt; the crowd was more in
the junior to mid level range now the crowd was more into the senior level range
which made for better talks and discussions. The most interesting sessions
for me were &lt;em&gt;On-boarding of New Team Members&lt;/em&gt; by Nikola Naidenov and
&lt;em&gt;Agile Leadership&lt;/em&gt; by Bogoi Bogdanov. Here are some of the highlights
that I wrote down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-boarding of new team members is very important. You need to have a plan for
their first 6 months at the company. This plan needs to have clearly defined tasks
and expectations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a person becomes productive for their team/company it means they have been
on-boarded successfully;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company provided trainer is a good thing but they tend to focus on broader
knowledge, they don't cover team specific domain knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some companies provide both technical and business trainers for their teams;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very important to get timely feedback when you are the one providing training.
However feedback isn't always easy to get and we don't always receive sincere feedback;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the team is swamped with work tasks you need to provide 10-20% of the time
for learning and experimenting with new technologies. IMO this is best done by
filing tickets in your bug/task tracking system and prioritizing them together with
the rest of the tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also important to have an individual training plan for each team member
and review this on a regular basis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should strive to use unified terminology and jargon as to not confuse
people. IMO it is usually the new hires who are likely to get confused because they
are not familiar with the history of the terms used;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an agile environment we calculate productivity using the formula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Productivity = Effort * Competence * Environment * Motivation^2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are 3 important factors that drive motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have a &lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to feel &lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be able to achieve &lt;strong&gt;Mastery&lt;/strong&gt; in your skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that autonomy is not the opposite of alignment
as depicted by the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alignment and autonomy" src="/images/alignment_autonomy.jpg" title="alignment and autonomy" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In agile environment control is a function of trust. To be able to trust people we
need to give them autonomy, transparency and short feedback loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage for the normal treat exceptions as exceptional;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure recovery is more important than failure avoidance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fail fast means learning fast and improving fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;

testing CSS animations (
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxzzfFBR8o&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=6"&gt;video in Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;
). The software under test was an ad tech SDK which
provides CSS based animations to mobile apps and games. The content
is displayed inside a webview and they had to make sure animations were
working correctly on different OS and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the content (aka getting to know the domain) they figured out
in reality there were about 20 basic movements and transformations. So the
problem was reduced to "How do we test these 20 basic movements under
various OSes and devices" or "How do we verify that basic CSS transformations
are supported under different versions and flavors of the OS"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their test bed included hand crafted web pages with each basic movement
and then several ones with more complex animations (aka integration testing).
The idea was to load
these pages under different devices and inspect whether or not the animations
were visualized properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test script (aka their testing framework) was constantly recording the
coordinates of the elements under test to verify that they were really animated.
The idea was to use a sample rate of 20ms and expect at lest 20 different changes
to the element under test. Coordinates along with color and gradient were recorded
and then returned back and analyzed to report a PASS or FAIL result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simplistic framework has limitations of course. It is not currently checking
the boundaries of where the elements are rendered on the screen. Thus if everything
else works as expected this will be a false positive result. On their slides
this can be seen at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MIxzzfFBR8o?t=23m10s"&gt;23:10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note the entire effort took about 2 days, including research and preparing
the test content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the back to basics approach here and the simplistic framework that
MentorMate came up with. Sure it misses some problems but for that particular case
it is good enough, easy and fast to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>The Passionate Doer</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/21/the-passionate-doer/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-21T00:18:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-21:blog/2016/10/21/the-passionate-doer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Passionate violinist" src="/images/passionate.jpg" title="Passionate violinist" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I visited &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/factorystartup/"&gt;Startup Factory Ruse&lt;/a&gt;
and had the opportunity to attend
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1148556138570764/"&gt;The Passionate Doer – Lessons Learned&lt;/a&gt;
where Yana Petrova shared her journey with &lt;a href="http://cokitchen.bg"&gt;CoKitchen&lt;/a&gt;
in the past 2 years.
The event name comes from &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2eyyRkx"&gt;The Passionate Programmer&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doer is somebody who acts and strives to make changes. When you jump into something new
it looks hard and scary at first. With time the important and difficult tasks
begin to look like ordinary ones because you gain the experience required for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are a start-up company you have a limited amount of time and finance to
make a break through. Thus it is important to hire the right people, but Yana argues
it is more important to quickly dismiss the people who don't fit into your
organization. I quite agree with her and the following paragraphs are centered
around this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point Yana makes is about negative reactions and lack of motivation
in employees.
When a person is lacking motivation they have troubles making logical
connections between various tasks and are not able to see the big picture
or how their actions or lack thereof affect everything else in the
organization.
She thinks these are most likely due to problems in our private
lives instead of problems at work and as managers we should seek to understand
what triggers these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana believes fatigue makes us vulnerable to negative thoughts so it is best
to make important decisions after you've had a good rest. In similar fashion
her way to deal with a non-motivated employee is to give them a short break.
Then she asks whether or not the employee is
ready to return back to work and invest 100% into the job. If not then
both parties say good bye to each other. Yana also says that for most
problematic employees she'd seen it hasn't been worth it to bring them back
and try to improve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked Yana if she had some sort of test to keep track of how well
a person performs their job. She didn't quite answer but an indicator
for under-performance to her is how busy the rest of the team is. Unwillingness
to take corrective action, e.g. explore new ways of doing things, acquire
more skills or read particular books which will help improve on areas
she'd identified, is also a good indicator that the person will have a
tendency to under-perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana says she wouldn't keep an employee who defines their own boundaries
and doesn't want to expand them because that person will not go out of their
comfort zone. This leaves everyone else tiptoeing around that employee
and having to do the job they can't, which puts more stress on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same approach we should adopt towards customers as well. Get rid of rude and
angry customers so that the work flows with less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana has been part of many volunteer efforts and her mistake was that she
expected everyone to have the same volunteering spirit that she has. In reality
it turned out people had trouble managing their own time or lacking the
proper communication skills. Not taking responsibility for your actions and
not learning from mistakes are other traits she noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CoKitchen they aim at pairing completely different people with one another
so that everyone is able to learn the most from the other person. This is
part of their internal mentorship program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting book mentioned by a member of the audience was
&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2drohhT"&gt;Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us&lt;/a&gt;.
The book reveals the three elements of true motivation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AUTONOMY - the desire to direct our own lives;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MASTERY - the urge to get better and better at something that matters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PURPOSE - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an interesting book (from the point of view of the employer)
which is definitely going into my reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry if my notes are a bit terse this time, it's been a busy month.
I still hope you learned something new from this post. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first
&lt;a href="http://www.2016.gemorg.bg/"&gt;GEM Conference in Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; took place on
Monday and Tuesday. I missed most of the sessions due to other meetings
and tasks but managed to attend a workshop on the topic
&lt;strong&gt;How to harness the power of influence and communication in entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;
by Plamen Popov and Yassar Markos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3 Fundamentals for Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Plamen and Yassar there are 3 key fundamentals for any kind of
communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willingness&lt;/strong&gt; to pay the price for this communication to happen;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; because we need to try different approaches until we
reach the desired person in a way they can understand what we're saying;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt; because we always need to be consistent in what we deliver
to others so that we always match their expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 Communication Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are 4 basic communication styles based on how formal or informal
the communication is and how passive or aggressive it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director&lt;/strong&gt; aka dominant style - they exhibit formal and aggressive
communication. Key words for them are results, effectiveness, no small talk,
to the point. They dislike wasting their time because they always have something
better and more interesting to do. This is why people in this group are
the worst listeners. They love conflicts and seek ideas and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expresser&lt;/strong&gt; aka promoting style are dominant/aggressive but informal.
They are loud, always speak about
themselves, they want public attention and to be unique. They forget details but instead
are able to grasp the big picture quite easily. They have lots of energy and
passion and love to start new projects and don't complete them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonizer&lt;/strong&gt; aka supportive style - they exhibit informal and passive
communication. They love connections and relationships, they use soft
language and look after people and team mates. They don't like conflicts and
competitive games. People from this style get impressed when you share
personal stories and details with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinker&lt;/strong&gt; aka analytical style people are formal but non-aggressive. They
like to know all the facts and always ask lots of questions because they need
to understand the big picture. They need time to understand before they can make
a decision. In their lives everything has a particular place. They are prone to
postponing tasks until they reach perfection (which they never will).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person typically has one dominant style and a mix of one or two others. I myself
am mostly Director and Expresser aka dominant and promoting with a pinch of Thinker.
I mostly lack the Harmonizer traits. However it is more important to know what
style the person you are talking to is, not what your personal style is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When judging the style of others take into account where you stand. A person who
is strongly formal and aggressive will view a less formal and mild person as the
Expresser or Harmonizer style. However to a 3rd party both of these two persons may
appear to be dominated by the Director style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make a Good Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presenting to a single person or a small group obviously you have to tailor
your presentation according to their communication styles. However when presenting
before a large and diverse crowd you need to account for all of them in the following
order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture the Expresser or promoting style by giving them a promise for something
cool and interesting. Because they easily forget details and become distracted you
can lose them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then capture the Director or dominant style by asserting your authority. State your
expertise in the field to establish trust. Also sell them the idea for efficiency
because this is the value they need to extract from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third comes the Harmonizer or supportive style. They seek open people to
connect with. Personal stories and struggles are the best way to engage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last comes the Thinker or analytical style. They need to know all the information
so you have to give them links and materials for further reading. It is also
a good idea to give them the ability to ask you questions later (via email, chat, etc)
because they will analyze your ideas and come up with more questions on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already started to organize my presentations based on the above 4 key points
so hopefully you will see me delivering better talks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Learned from IT Weekend</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-08T13:48:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-08:blog/2016/10/08/what-i-learned-from-it-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IT Weekend" src="/images/itweekend.png" title="IT Weekend" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended the first &lt;a href="http://it-weekend.com"&gt;IT Weekend&lt;/a&gt; in Bulgaria.
It's like a training camp for athletes but for QA engineers. There were 20 people
attending and the format was very friendly and relaxed. The group had members with
various levels of experience and technical skills, also different areas they work in.
All presentations are on
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRA3tRwclRU&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.
Here's a brief of what happened and what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the honor to present in the first slot and gave a quick introduction
to mutation testing. This was my first time giving this talk and I'm not entirely
happy with how I've presented it. Also mutation testing is touching a lot on unit tests,
programming and source code which in some organizations goes to the devel department.
I think mutation testing is harder to understand from people not familiar with it
than I initially thought. I'm taking note to improve the way I present this topic
to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yavor Donev gave a good overview of Appium and how to use it on Android.
The most important question for me was "&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to utilize the same test suite
on Android and iOS, given that the environments are different&lt;/em&gt;". With this I mean
regardless of how much we try to make the same (native) app on both platforms
it will end up differently because the platforms are essentially different. For
example there is a different number of physical buttons available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume that both iOS and Android apps follow the same design and use
similar workflow then it should be possible to create a test suite which is
platform aware and account for the minor differences. We're also adding
another layer of complexity by introducing the requirement that both apps stay
in sync with each other and account for the quirks of the foreign platform.
Depending on your apps and goals this may not be an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I didn't like about Appium is that upstream doesn't care much about
version compatibility and they tend to break and change stuff arbitrary between
releases. That said if it works, don't update it or otherwise be extremely
careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a nice chat with Yavor on the topic of career change, learning to
program and working with people who have very little coding experience. His
approach is to develop a higher level test framework on top of Appium which
his team mates can use more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aneta Petkova's &lt;em&gt;Selenium Grid in Unix Environment&lt;/em&gt; is a bit out of my domain.
However I took one important lesson: regardless of how great your tools are
there are minor details which can make or break your day. In her case these
are the physical location of the tests (e.g. which Selenium node runs them) and
access to shared resources. Turns out WebDriver doesn't give you
this information directly and you need to go through hoops to get it. Her
solution was to place the test code on the Grid Hub and provide a shared file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger lesson is: whenever you have to design an automated test environment
(aka test lab) make sure to evaluate your needs beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last talk was a guest appearance by Denitsa Evtimova. She is a QA architect
with 16 years of experience and presented the QA strategy at Paysafe group.
They have a large monolithic system (legacy code) and have adopted a pyramid
style approach to testing. Whenever possible tests are brought down to the lowest
level (e.g. unit tests) and not repeated on the higher levels. At the top
stand manual testing. Teams are small: 3-4 developers and 2-3 QAs. It is the team
responsibility to make sure tests are implemented at the lowest possible level.
The process is not strictly enforced and the company relies more on self
governance in this aspect. Also everyone on the team can contribute
additional tests whenever they see something missing.
Test (writing) tasks are all logged in JIRA. They are also small so that
everything can be completed in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was more informal. We did a quick exploratory testing
exercise and shared opinions on different test tools. Then the group had
a discussion about soft skills and how QA engineers can change the perception
of developers about the QA profession (especially in teams where there are many
manual testers). The key points are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criticize the software, not the person, e.g. don't blame the person directly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate with concrete facts and data, not emotions and perceptions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes of the type "how many QA engineers are needed to screw a light bulb"
are a problem because they lead to underestimation of the job role;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it is not quite clear (to others) how the QA role contributes to
the development of the product and the organization;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a QA it is important to be able to give a non-biased opinion and
observations on what is happening with the product/process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A QA person needs to be very calm. They have to be able to listen to
everybody (especially developers) and accept their point of view but at
the same time also communicate their own point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important
to sit together with developers and observe the problem, brainstorm and
propose possible solutions. This also creates a feedback loop where the
developer feels empowered because he's part of the process identifying
the problem and proposing the best solution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In agile teams it is a good idea to rotate people between developer and
QA positions. This will help them better understand the job of others,
acquire new skills and also bring fresh thinking to the team;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance is an ungrateful job and only people with very calm and methodical
thinking (to follow through and write all possible scenarios) are able to excel
in this field. On the other hand developer usually think about the happy path
scenarios and strive to make their code work as best as they can;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By rotating job roles within the team developers
will quickly find out that testing is not their field and gain respect
towards their QA peers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US managers have the habit of telling "good job" to everyone, even for
small and routine tasks. In Bulgaria (and maybe elsewhere) we're not used
to this. Instead we're used of being scolded when we do something wrong.
If everything is good then we don't receive any recognition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the American "good job" is actually a good thing. Team mates will
start performing better over time because they will feel their work is
valued and not meaningless, they will feel recognized which will boost
morale and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="events"></category><category term="QA"></category></entry><entry><title>Peter Sabev on Test Automation</title><link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/10/07/petar-sabev-on-test-automation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-07T11:30:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Todorov</name></author><id>tag:atodorov.org,2016-10-07:blog/2016/10/07/petar-sabev-on-test-automation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the automation snake chart" src="/images/petar_sabev_automation.jpg" title="The automation snake chart" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Peter Sabev gave his talk
"On Reporting Bugs: Errors Made and Lessons learned" for DEV.bg
(&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVY3U58Js90&amp;amp;index=6&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db"&gt;watch in Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;).
At the end of the talk there was a quick question how would he approach automation.
I have always approached automation in terms of manpower and skills available
within the team while he proposed an approach based on return of investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that you have a team with strong understanding of the
software (code) under test and they have good coding skills then start with the
hardest test cases first. This way the team will have lots of hard work
upfront and there will be some lead time without visible results.
However when the hardest/most complex test cases are already automated you
will most likely have covered a big portion of the SUT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, when you start with the easiest test cases first then
the team will progress gradually and have enough time to get to grips
with the SUT. You are also more likely to see more regressions or bugs
missed. With this approach every subsequent automated test will be harder
to write and more complex than the previous one. This is a good fit for
team who don't have strong experience with test automation and/or are
unfamiliar with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter proposes a different approach. He plots the test cases as dots, based
on how much time they take to execute manually and how much time/how hard
is it to automate the particular case. Then you start to move from the lower right
corner towards the upper left corner in a weaving motion, like a snake,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His argument is that once you automate the test cases which are not very complex
but require lots of time to execute by hand then you free up resources
within the team. As you progress up the chart the test cases become harder
to automate and yield less return of investment because they don't take
some much time to execute manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about Peter's approach please read
&lt;a href="http://waset.org/publications/10003250/manual-to-automated-testing-an-effort-based-approach-for-determining-the-priority-of-software-test-automation"&gt;his article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the snake chart the team constantly faces test scenarios
jumping up and down on the automation hardness scale. Which also means
that you need to have the suitable skills within the team. IMO this is best
suited for teams where each member has different degree of experience.
I'm also in favor of using the snake chart as a tool to distribute
automation tasks within the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my frequent readers may know I try to summarize all the conferences
and events I go to. This year's EuRuKo inspired me to take a different
approach and instead of quickly summarizing the event I will try to
highlight what I have learned from it! My intention is to use this as a
tool to improve my skills and the work I do. It will probably be a long
post so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say that I don't consider myself a Ruby developer although I do
write a small amount of Ruby code. I also don't really consider myself a
developer although I have a formal degree in software engineering and do
my fair share of open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being different and thinking differently has always been helpful to me in
Quality Assurance and this time was no exception. Attending a conference
I knew nothing about and meeting with people whose job is totally different
than mine turned out to be my greatest experience on the conference circuit
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get out of the comfort zone, meet new
people, exchange ideas and learn!&lt;/strong&gt; The very fact that I am writing this post
not following my usual summary style proves this is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very early during the event I started to notice a recurring theme which grew
stronger by the minute. The Ruby community is very open and inclusive to newcomers
and they seem to be doing a very good job about on-boarding everyone who wants to
learn. I already wrote about Ivan Nemitchenko's
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2016/09/25/what-ivan-learned-from-organizing-internships/"&gt;experience of organizing remote internships&lt;/a&gt;
and there are also the Rails Girls local communities, the 
&lt;a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/"&gt;Rails Girls Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (didn't know about it)
and the various local Ruby communities who pitched their cities to host the next
EuRuKo. I really loved this feeling of community. In the broader Linux, Python and
QA world I have not seen this being so pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open up (the open source) community even more. Make it easier for newcomers to join!
Treat them as human and don't expect them to be like yourself. Do teach and mentor
both to help newcomers but also to help yourself become better!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly on par with my community work but I think I can do better. I will take
the time to evaluate what I've been doing in the past and identify areas for improvements.
I also encourage my readers and students to send me feedback as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned that junior developers can make meaningful
contributions to production grade code when they are given the appropriate set of tasks
and guidance. Stephanie Nemeth argued that companies should hire (more) enthusiastic
career changers as junior developers because they have very strong motivation for
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate how we look at junior developers, especially how we examine and hire them
and how we on-board them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lessons 2 and 3 are valid in the open source world and even more so in the
corporate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked the fact that some of the lightning talks were given by people who
had no previous experience in Ruby. @TeamJoda2016 talked about what they did and
learn throughout the summer and really cracked the room with their
"oh and btw we are looking for a job" as their final slide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are new/inexperienced at something don't be afraid to try it out. Give it
the best you've got and see how it goes. Worst case .... well nothing bad really happens,
best case you end up doing the best job in your life.&lt;/strong&gt; That's also been my
&lt;a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/19/7-years-1400-bugs-red-hat-qa/"&gt;personal experience with software testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carina C. Zona's &lt;em&gt;Consequences Of An Insightful Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;
(old video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheE6udjfGI&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=28"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
dealt with the ethical
responsibilities of us as developers and this is becoming more common with deep learning neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re able to extract remarkably precise
intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn’t
consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krissy's &lt;em&gt;The HTT(Pancake) Request&lt;/em&gt; made a great analogy of consuming APIs with
your customer experience when visiting a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design APIs (software in general) as if that was a physical product where your
customers happiness matters&lt;/strong&gt;. We see this all the time in our daily jobs and we're
guilty of doing it as well. Btw at the moment I'm in the middle of huge refactoring
of &lt;a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit"&gt;django-chartit&lt;/a&gt; which breaks all
backwards compatibility. I guess I will have to re-evaluate my design and approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By accident I've made good friends with Alex Georgiev and the folks at Fyber.
I liked the fact that at the conference they had couple of people
working in QA and we managed to have a nice talk about QA vs developers and the transformation
between the two. That also touched on the bigger subject of testers not being able to
code and testers not being available for hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving people to improve their skills (learn to code, write tests, etc) is possible
but needs to come from management, needs clear direction and also a little bit of peer pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all isn't that what an agile team is supposed to be ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now being the able to code, not entirely Ruby ignorant QA guy that I am I was
immediately offered several positions in London and Berlin (and no I'm still staying
in Sofia). As it turned out good QA engineers with good development skills are
in greater demand than developers not only in Sofia but all around the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellow QA guys, please do learn to program. Dear developers, please try thinking
more like a tester the next time you write code&lt;/strong&gt; (me included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring a barista and furnishing your company stand with the best coffee machine
you can afford while having an ugly hand written sign saying "MAIN CONFERENCE COFFEE -&amp;gt;"
is a marketing stunt that I really love. I'm not sure how well that worked for their
hiring but it got them visibility. I'm definitely stealing this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference coffee sucks. Provide better one and developers will queue at your stand.
To a greater extent - research your target and their needs and provide a product
that solves their problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we gave back&lt;/h2&gt;

EuRuKo yesterday
(slides &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/creatop/my-experiense-of-remote-internship-for-junior-ruby-developers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
I'm writing this because that was the best talk both
in terms of content and visual presentation I saw at the conference and because
it is closely related to my work with &lt;a href="http://hackbulgaria.com"&gt;HackBulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short story is that at some point Ivan was mentoring several junior developers
and saw the need to scale this effort so he did a call for interns and got back 60 replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What an Intern Gets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects in their portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working experience, including team work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing an entire product from idea to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan wanted to find suitable interns who have basic Ruby on Rails knowledge
and who could invest a minimum of 20 hours per week of their time so he devised
an aptitude test of 3 parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The three part test &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inem"&gt;@inem&lt;/a&gt; used to challenge 60 candidates for a Ruby internship. Pretty cool. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/euruko?src=hash"&gt;#euruko&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsnN03pXkf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsnN03pXkf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tatiana Stantonian (@binaryberry) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/binaryberry/status/779664766394564608"&gt;September 24, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 is developing basic functionality of the product.
Part 2 was adding different user types which require different validation logic, etc.
Part 3 was adding "purchasing" logic via external APIs. In Part 3 intentionally
there was no code review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was shit! That was the purpose of the test. The reasoning being that
there is no right or wrong way to solve the problems he presented to the interns. Instead
he wanted to make them think and decide on a solution. Then feel the pain of their decision.
Ivan argues that what made us senior developers are these pains we have experienced at some
point in our careers, those fuck-ups that we did in some old project. All of them made us
better in our job because we could learn from the mistakes we've made and more importantly
understand the consequence of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common mistakes Ivan saw were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring levels of abstraction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using too many gems without knowing or understanding their limitations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gems were treated as the only way to solve a problem. More importantly changing
this way was out of the question;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interns didn't know about &lt;a href="http://stevelorek.com/service-objects.html"&gt;service objects&lt;/a&gt;,
well even some experienced developers seem to not know that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business logic was all around the place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad naming all around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing Ivan did was a group hangout code review followed by a short lecture about
design patterns, a refactoring session and finally cross code review. At the end the
product was delivered as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following these initial efforts Ivan continued (with even more interns, or the next group of them I think)
by asking interns to develop internship automatization, that is a means for the system to
distribute tasks based on git commits, tags, etc so it can scale. They've added an admin
dashboard and started working on an open source alternative to NewRelic (if I got that correctly).
He was also able to enlist 2 more mentors to help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems Ivan found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough mentors and external projects to work on for all of the interns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treating a project as not real (e.g. not a real world product) is a mistake;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A training project has the same management issues that a real product will have
and they need to be resolved in pretty much the same way;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was collective irresponsibility from the group of interns. They didn't do
what they said they will do;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were communication issues between the interns and the lack of enough mentors
was an obvious problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was also lack of motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say these are the typical problems one also sees in almost any teams. It doesn't
matter if these are teams of students or teams of developers inside some company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What a Junior Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A real project to work on;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A business context, a reason why something should be done and why it needs to be
done in a particular way&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some visible achievement for their portfolio;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team work experience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole cycle development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan thinks that &lt;strong&gt;the aptitude test worked great&lt;/strong&gt; because his interns were able to find
good jobs afterwards but he will change a few things. There will be even more tests
and he will reject unfit/bad interns. He will also do call for mentors not only for interns.
And he wants to turn mentors' experience into tests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the "business context" item. IMO even seasoned developers need to have this
if they are expected to create a great product for their company. We're not just coders but
sometimes companies forget that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also wondering how can I apply a similar aptitude test in my work (both mentoring at
HackBulgaria and otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How about Senior Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all have routine tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and research tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice to have features and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low priority features;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side project ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing features in their favorite open source projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior developers' tasks and desires will have to align with what a junior needs in order
for the mentorship to work. As senior devs we often make a mistake and expect everyone else
to think the same way we do and act as fast as we do. &lt;strong&gt;Ideally senior developers want to have multiple clones
of ourselves to work with!&lt;/strong&gt; I myself have been guilty of that and trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of a for-profit company the above findings should be taken into deep consideration
if you are about to have interns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk I was lucky to talk to Ivan and tell him more about the training sessions
at HackBulgaria. I also proposed to him the sponsorship model which he hasn't considered.
He then made a counter offer: ask interns for high payment upfront and let them recoup that
based on their progress towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really happy to have heard this presentation and being able to talk to Ivan in person. I also have
my notes about my "QA and Automation 101" training at HackBulgaria and I now
have a better idea how to go about organizing and summarizing them (will try to publish that soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Ivan works at GitLab and promised to look at an issue I personally have
so here it is &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/7953"&gt;GitLab #7953&lt;/a&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/617994718381217/"&gt;Questers Beer'n'Code Day&lt;/a&gt;
which was an open air mini-conference held at the terrace of their office.
As to organization the only drawback was the summer sun which made it impossible
to see anything on the screen. Most speakers were OK with that although they
wanted to show some code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recorded all talks and they are available in my
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2ILL8Xq5s&amp;amp;list=PLFjlI7p-h1hxBP3cIjEqePSeoBDHud5Db&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;TECH TALKS&lt;/a&gt;
YouTube play list. You can also hear me asking some questions from behind
the camera. All of the talks are in Bulgarian though, so sorry for my
English speaking readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon started with Lidiya Georgieva and her talk about clean code
and code smells. I find the topic particularly interesting but she didn't
go into more details. She said she had used SonarCube but couldn't recommend
any other tools, except for the standard lint style ones. I have been using
&lt;a href="https://landscape.io/github/MrSenko/pelican-ab/"&gt;LandScape.io&lt;/a&gt; for all
Python based code I've been working on recently and I think it is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talk I found interesting was by my fellow QA Petar Sabev on reporting
bugs. It was more of an entry level talk, but still very informative for both
less experienced QAs and other technical folks so I definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one, and most interesting, was Bogoi Bogdanov with Scaling Agile.
Despite the name
he covered some basics about Agile and what it actually is. Afterwards we've stayed
and talked for a good 2 hours more. I definitely would like to hear more from
him in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to Questers for hosting this event and allowing me to record it.

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Oct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GCC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20140911&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linux2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Apr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mo"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GCC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20140911&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unorderable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the second elements in both lists have different keys
and Python doesn't know how to compare them. In earlier Python versions
this has been special cased as
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3484293/is-there-a-description-of-how-cmp-works-for-dict-objects-in-python-2/3484456#3484456"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;
by Ned Batchelder (the author of Python's coverage tool) but in Python 3
dictionaries have no natural sort order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;em&gt;django-chartit&lt;/em&gt; (of which I'm now the official maintainer) this
bug triggers when you want to plot data from multiple sources (models) on the same
chart. In this case the fields coming from each data series are different and the
above error is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked around this in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/chartit/django-chartit/commit/9d9033ecd5a8592a12872293cdf6d710cebf894f"&gt;commit 9d9033e&lt;/a&gt;
by simply disabling an iterator sort but this is sub-optimal and I'm not quite certain
what the side effect might be. I suspect you may end up with a chart where the order
of values on the X axis isn't the same for the different models, e.g. one graph plotting
the data in ascending order the other one in descending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble also comes from the fact that we're sorting an iterator (a list of fields) by
telling Python to use a list of dicts to determine the sort order. In this arrangement
there is no way to tell Python how we want to compare our dicts. The only solution I
can think about is creating a custom class and implementing a custom &lt;code&gt;__cmp__()&lt;/code&gt; method
for this data structure!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QA"></category><category term="Python"></category></entry></feed>
