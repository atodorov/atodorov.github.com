    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/19/tip-cut-leading-or-trailing-fields-from-strings-in-bash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was looking for a command sequence to cut a string in two by predefined
delimiter (e.g. like <code>cut</code> does). I wanted to get the last field only and all
fields but the last as separate variables.</p>

<p>The proposed solutions I&#8217;ve found suggested using <code>awk</code> but I don&#8217;t like it.
Here&#8217;s a simple solution using <code>cut</code> and <code>rev</code> which can extract arbitrary
field counts from the end of the string.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f1 -d. | rev
org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f-2 -d. | rev
fedoraproject.org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f-3 -d. | rev
phx2.fedoraproject.org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f2- -d. | rev
buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f3- -d. | rev
buildvm-08.phx2
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f4- -d. | rev
buildvm-08
</code></pre>

<p>The magic here is done by <code>rev</code> which reverses the order of characters in every
line. It comes with the <em>util-linux-ng</em> package.</p>

<p><strong>Note to Self:</strong> <em>util-linux-ng</em> appears to contain more useful commands which
I wasn&#8217;t aware of. Need to RTFM a little bit.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/13/keeping-backwards-compatibility-for-pykickstart/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-13T23:59:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/13/keeping-backwards-compatibility-for-pykickstart</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> templates as part of my
installation testing work;</li>
<li>SNAKE has a dependency on pykickstart;</li>
<li>To test the latest and greatest kickstart features in Fedora we need the
latest version of pykickstart;</li>
<li>Latest pykickstart needs Python 2.7</li>
<li>Python 2.7 is not available on RHEL 6 which is used to host the test
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just yesterday I hit an issue with the above setup and figured Fedora QA is
in a kind of strange situation - we always need the latest but need it
conservative enough to run on RHEL 6. See the original thread at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/kickstart-list/2013-November/msg00001.html">kickstart-list</a>.</p>

<p>In this particular case the solution will be to remove the offending code
and implement the same functionality in backward-compatible manner. Also add
more tests. I will be working on this tomorrow (there&#8217;s an older patch already).</p>

<p>The BIG question remains though - how do you manage software evolution and still
keep it compatible with older execution stacks? Please share your experience in
the comments section.</p>

<hr />

<p>PP: Spoiler - this is part of an ongoing effort to bring open source installation
testing expertise (my domain) into Fedora world, plus establish a community supported
test infrastructure. More info TBA soon.</p>

which was inspired by real events.</p>

<p>The comments at the bottom are very interesting. It looks like Fedora needs to
make some changes in the bug reporting process and tools.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI</a> starts tonight!
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/">During the previous edition</a> of the hackathon
I gave one team a special personal gift based on my estimation of their hacker level!
Thanks to <a href="http://blog.ganev.bg">Vihren Ganev</a> (one of the gift winners) for reminding
me about that!</p>

<p>This year I have even bigger items to give to those who think out of the box, who hack
their way around and are brave enough to try and change the world through software!
I have one
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWCS52/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AWCS52&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Lenovo Thinkpad Business Backpack</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001AWCS52" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and one
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TX7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004TX7H&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Lowepro D-Res 20 AW Digital Camera Bag</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00004TX7H" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
(a bit bigger than the one on Amazon, easily fits a BlackBerry Z10) as seen on the pictures below.
Plus some small Red Hat branded items.</p>

<h2>How To Get The Gifts</h2>

<p>There are no rules, I will make a decision as I go along.
I can give away all items or none. It&#8217;s up to you! Surprise me!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be mentoring the teams who decided to work with Django but
I&#8217;m happy to talk to anyone who needs help or just wants to grab the
cool stuff! See you there!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/13/tip-extending-btrfs-filesystem-for-fedora-virtual-machine/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-13T14:53:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/13/tip-extending-btrfs-filesystem-for-fedora-virtual-machine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was testing Fedora 20 inside a KVM guest this week when the disk
space run out. The system was configured to use Btrfs filesystem and this is how
to extend it.</p>

<p>First you have to extend the underlying guest storage. On the host I&#8217;m using LVM
so this is a no brainer:</p>

<pre><code># pvs
  PV                                                    VG              Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
  /dev/mapper/luks-f3f6cea1-baba-4aaf-bca8-33a0ec540369 vg_redbull_mini lvm2 a--  289,11g 134,11g

# lvs
  LV            VG              Attr      LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  vm_fedora     vg_redbull_mini -wi-ao---  15,00g                                             

# lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/vg_redbull_mini-vm_fedora 
  Extending logical volume vm_fedora to 20,00 GiB
  Logical volume vm_fedora successfully resized

# lvs
  LV            VG              Attr      LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  vm_fedora     vg_redbull_mini -wi-ao---  20,00g                                             

# pvs
  PV                                                    VG              Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
  /dev/mapper/luks-f3f6cea1-baba-4aaf-bca8-33a0ec540369 vg_redbull_mini lvm2 a--  289,11g 129,11g
</code></pre>

<p>On the VM we have a default Btrfs layout:</p>

<pre><code># blkid
/dev/vda1: UUID="410ee563-e701-42ff-9d5f-5805dd103e35" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="0000330f-01" 
/dev/vda2: UUID="f4addad4-a0fc-482e-ad5a-240864b76f09" TYPE="swap" PARTUUID="0000330f-02" 
/dev/vda3: LABEL="fedora" UUID="f0b589ce-061c-4ac3-826e-7f3f8c8a6d30" UUID_SUB="11aa8414-3ce1-4fe7-a506-9a4f91ba5c30" TYPE="btrfs" PARTUUID="0000330f-03" 

# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda3        13G   11G  1.4G  89% /
devtmpfs        996M     0  996M   0% /dev
tmpfs          1002M   80K 1002M   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs          1002M  668K 1002M   1% /run
tmpfs          1002M     0 1002M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs          1002M   16K 1002M   1% /tmp
/dev/vda3        13G   11G  1.4G  89% /home
/dev/vda1       477M   72M  376M  17% /boot
</code></pre>

<p>Now power-off (not reboot) and power-on the VM guest so that it sees the new size
of the underlying storage. See the fdisk header (line 9 below), vda is now 20GiB!</p>

<p>Before extending the filesystem you have to extend the underlying disk partition! This is the
trickiest part. Using fdisk or parted you have to delete the partition and add it again.
Make sure to use the <strong>SAME</strong> starting sector for the new partition (line 33)!</p>

<p>Every once in a while ABRT will tell you that reporting is disabled because
backtrace is unusable. What it means is that it can&#8217;t read some of the debugging
symbols and the most likely reason for that is debuginfo packages are missing.</p>

<p>To install them first locate the directory containing the files for that particular
crash. Use the <code>executable</code> file to find out if you are looking into the correct
directory. Then use this one liner to install the missing debuginfo packages.</p>

<pre><code># pwd
/var/tmp/abrt/ccpp-2013-10-10-15:55:18-15533
# cat backtrace | grep lib | tr -s ' ' | cut -f4 -d' ' | sort | uniq | grep "/" | xargs rpm -qf --qf "%{name}\n" | xargs debuginfo-install -y

<p>Here is my summary of the second Fedora Test Day hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Local attendance was a total disaster, in fact I was testing once again by my own.
This time
there were more people in the lab, all busy with their daily routines and tasks.
There were no people who came for the testing :(. I will have to try different
venues in the future and see if the situation improves.</p>

<p>On the testing front I managed to score 5 bugs against
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=709797,709799,709806,709810">GNOME</a>
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017807">Fedora</a>.
You can see the other test results and bugs on the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-10_Gnome_3.10">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>There are two things I didn&#8217;t like in particular</p>

<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 as well as its classic mode - simply not the environment I&#8217;m used to;</li>
<li>Having to record test results in the wiki! I&#8217;m
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-October/118284.html">writing</a>
to the Fedora QA mailing list about that as we speak.</li>
</ul>


<p>At one time I was engaged in a discussion about which Bulgarian keyboard layout
should be the default in GNOME simply because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709799">GNOME #709799</a>. The default
keyboard layout will be Bulgarian (traditional phonetic) aka bg+phonetic.</p>

<blockquote><p>(16,13,26) rtcm: atodorov: are you bulgarian and/or live in bulgaria?<br/>(16,14,20) rtcm: atodorov: if yes, I wanted to know which keyboard layout most people expect there to be the default<br/>(16,16,34) atodorov: rtcm: I&#8217;m a Bulgarian, however I can&#8217;t tell which one. Both Phonetic and standard (BDS) are common<br/>(16,16,54) atodorov: a safe bet is to go with phonetic I guess. <br/>(16,19,46) rtcm: atodorov: can you tell me which one is it in XKB terms? is it &#8220;bg&#8221;, &#8220;bg+bas_phonetic&#8221; or &#8220;bg+phonetic&#8221; ?<br/>(16,20,51) rtcm: they&#8217;re labeled as &#8220;Bulgarian&#8221;, &#8220;Bulgarian (new phonetic)&#8221; and &#8220;Bulgarian (traditional phonetic)&#8221;<br/>(16,21,30) atodorov: bg+phonetic is the traditional phonetic<br/>(16,22,04) atodorov: bg labeled as &#8220;Bulgarian&#8221; is the standard one I guess. Here we call it BDS after the standardization institute<br/>(16,22,34) atodorov: bg+bas_phonetic is created from the Bulgarian Academy of Science and is not very popular as far as I know. I&#8217;ve never seen it in use<br/>(16,23,15) rtcm: atodorov: all I want to know is what most people would expect? like what does windows do by default? that&#8217;s a good bet<br/>(16,27,46) atodorov: rtcm: I&#8217;m just being told that new Windows releases use yet another layout by default, which is like phonetic but with some characters in new places and people don&#8217;t like that<br/>(16,27,53) atodorov: my safe bet goes to bg+phonetic<br/>(16,29,05) rtcm: ok, thanks</p></blockquote>


<p>It is a rare occasion when you get to make a decision that affects a large group
of people and I hope you don&#8217;t hate me for that!</p>

<p>Do you want to see more Fedora Test Days happening in Sofia? Join me and I will
organize some more!</p>

    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/11/this-week-python-chris-dibona-openshift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a random collection of links I came across this week which
appear interesting to me but I don&#8217;t have time to blog about in details.</p>

<h2>Making a Multi-branch Test Server for Python Apps</h2>

<p>If you are wondering how to test different feature branches of your Python
application but don&#8217;t have the resources to create separate test servers this
is for you:
<a href="http://depressedoptimism.com/blog/2013/10/8/making-a-multi-branch-test-server">http://depressedoptimism.com/blog/2013/10/8/making-a-multi-branch-test-server</a>!</p>

<p><em>Kudos to the python-django-bulgaria Google group for finding this link!</em></p>

<h2>OpenSource.com Interview with Chris DiBona</h2>

<p>Just read it at
<a href="http://opensource.com/business/13/10/interview-chris-dibona">http://opensource.com/business/13/10/interview-chris-dibona</a>.</p>

<p>I particularly like the part where he called open source &#8220;brutal&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>You once called open source “brutal”. What did you mean by that?</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>I think that it is because open source projects are able to only work with the<br/>productive people and ignore everyone else. That behavior can come across as<br/>very harsh or exclusionary, and that&#8217;s because it is that: brutally harsh and<br/>exclusionary of anyone who isn&#8217;t contributing.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>So, I guess what I&#8217;m saying is that survival of the fittest as practiced in the<br/>open source world is a pretty brutal mechanism, but it works very very well for<br/>producing quality software. Boy is it hard on newcomers though&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<h2>OpenShift Finally Introduces Environment Variables</h2>

<p>Yes! Finally!</p>

<pre><code>    rhc set-env VARIABLE1=VALUE1 -a myapp
</code></pre>

<p>No need for
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/07/08/tip-setting-secure-env-variables-on-red-hat-openshift/">my work around</a>
anymore! I will give the new feature a go very soon.</p>

<p>Read more about it at the OpenShift blog:

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/08/fedora-20-virtualization-test-day-post-mortem/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-08T22:01:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/08/fedora-20-virtualization-test-day-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/fedora/fedora20-banner.png" title="Fedora 20 banner" alt="&quot;Fedora 20 banner&quot;" /></p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of the first Fedora Test Day in Sofia I hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> today.</p>

<p>Attendance was quite poor, actually nobody else except me participated but
almost nobody else visited the hackespace as well. I get that it is a
working day and Test Days conflict with regular business hours but this
is not going to change anyway. On the other hand where were all the freelancers
and non-office job workers who usually hang around in the Lab? I have no idea!</p>

<p>On IRC there was much better activity, 5 or 6 people were testing across
Asia, Europe and USA time zones. You can see the test results
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">here</a>.
I&#8217;ve started filing quite a few bugs in the morning and continued well into the
afternoon. I&#8217;ve managed to file a total of
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1016435,1016449,1016488,1016530,1016604,1016613,1016648,1016663,1016704,1016715">10 bugs</a>.
Some of them were not related to virtualization and some of them turned out to be
duplicates or not a bug. I even managed to file 2 duplicate bugs which likely have the
same root cause myself :).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also experienced two bugs filed by other people:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=967371">RHBZ #967371</a> for MATE desktop
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1015636">RHBZ #1015636</a> for
virt-manager&#8217;s Save/Restore functionality.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried ARM on x86_64 but that didn&#8217;t get anywhere near a running system.
I will make another post about ARM and what I&#8217;ve discovered there.</p>

<p>The one thing I liked is the
<a href="http://209.132.184.192/testdays/show_event?event_id=7">test results application</a>.
It is not what I&#8217;m used to when dealing with RHEL, has far less features but is
very fast and easy to use and suits the Test Days participants just fine.
And is definitely much easier to use compared to filing results in the wiki.</p>

<p>Overall Fedora 20 virtualization status according to me is pretty good.</p>

<p>I hope to see more attendance <a href="http://initlab.org/event/gnome-test-day">on Thursday</a>
when we&#8217;re going to test GNOME 3.10.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-15T10:23:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/09/15/lenovo-rants-battery-and-dock-flaws</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To all my readers - sorry for not being able to blog more frequently lately.
Here&#8217;s an easy read about my favourite laptop brand Lenovo and some of their
design flaws I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<h2>X220 and T60 Batterries are ALMOST Identical</h2>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/lenovo_x220_t60_battery.jpg" title="X220 and T60 batteries" alt="&quot;X220 and T60 batteries&quot;" /></p>

<p>As you can see the <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">X220</a> and
<a href="http://amzn.to/183SgiR">T60</a> batteries are nearly identical with the notable
exception of the connector placement. The end result - I have to purchase yet another
battery as a backup for long travel/work on the go. Not what I want.</p>

<p>I wish all Lenovo models had the same batteries so people can swap them around
as they wish. Is this too much to ask for? Have you seen another brand which
got this right?</p>

<h2>ThinkPad Mini Dock Design Flaw</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m using a <a href="http://amzn.to/15tjUYi">ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</a> docking station
with my X220 laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn&#8217;t quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/dock/alone.jpg" title="docking station in position 2" alt="docking station in position 2" /></p>

<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/dock/top.jpg" title="top view" alt="top view" />
<img src="http://atodorov.org/images/dock/back.jpg" title="back view" alt="back view" />
<img src="http://atodorov.org/images/dock/side.jpg" title="side view" alt="side view" /></p>

<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/dock/removed.jpg" title="blocking part removed" alt="blocking part removed" /></p>

<p>Even with this piece removed my laptop still hets up too much! I guess 80 C is just
normal for the Core i7 processors :(.</p>

<p>Have you found something not quite right in your hardware design? Please share in the
comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick
some developers&#8217; ass this is the way to do it!</p>

<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov&#8217;s „Oracle&#8217;s take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

<p>PS: this post was initially written on my <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>
with Penzus Editor - another small step in
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/01/laptop-vs-smartphone-part-one/">retiring my laptop</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-ebugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">previous post</a>
I asked the readers of this blog to pick a bug number from Red Hat&#8217;s Bugzilla
so I can analyze it later.</p>

<p><a href="http://radorado.me">Radoslav Georgiev</a> decided to step up and
selected the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">Leet</a> bug
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337</a></p>

<p>This is a rather old bug against kernel, in particular
against the token ring driver. There isn&#8217;t much info on the bug but it seems
the issue is hardware dependent and doesn&#8217;t reproduce reliably.</p>

<p>Looking at the bug status and history it looks like it was closed without
fixing it. Most likely the reason for this was there was no hardware
to test, bug was not reproduced and no customers were seeing the issue or
were willing to test and work with devel!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to see my comments on other interesting bugs just post a link
to them in the comments section.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/redhat_1mil_bugs.jpg" title="RHBZ 1 million" alt="&quot;RHBZ 1 million&quot;" /></p>

<p>Red Hat&#8217;s Bugzilla passed the 1 million bugs milestone yesterday!
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000">RHBZ #1000000</a> has been
filed by Anton Arapov, a kernel engineer and a very nice guy (I know him btw).
I&#8217;ve filed several bugs yesterday but the last one was #999941. A bit too short!</p>

<p>To celebrate this event I dare you to pick some bugs from Bugzilla that you find
interesting or frustrating and I will try to analyze and explain them from a
QA engineer&#8217;s point of view. Since I&#8217;ve reported over 1000 bugs and been involved in
another close to 5000 I think I will be able to answer almost any question.</p>

<p>Challenge accepted!</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/370833992074809345">reported it</a>. Let&#8217;s
see how long it takes for them to fix it!</p>

<p>One thing you need to know when ordering Red Hat subscriptions is your
account number. It is available in the drop down menu at the top right
corner after you login at <a href="https://access.redhat.com">https://access.redhat.com</a>.</p>

<p>New accounts don&#8217;t have an account number. It will be generated after
the first subscription activation.</p>

<p>If you need to know more about Red Hat&#8217;s ordering process just ask me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in February 2013 Russell Beattie has published an article on his blog
titled
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services">Artisanal Websites: The rise of .io domains for well crafted web services</a>
. He has compiled a great deal of sites in the .io domain space with screenshots
and links to each individual service. There are lots of interesting ones, so
go and check them out!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad Russell has added <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> as well!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> is coming to an end
I&#8217;m publishing an interesting update from
<a href="cz.linkedin.com/in/mullerpetr">Petr Muller</a> for
those who were not able to attend.
Petr is a Senior Quality Engineer at Red Hat. His notes were
sent to an internal QE mailing list and re-published with permission.</p>

<blockquote><p>As this year&#8217;s GUADEC happened in the same building where I have my<br/>other office, I decided to attend. I&#8217;m sharing my notes from the two<br/>sessions I consider to be especially interesting for the audience of<br/>this mailing list:</p><p>== How to not report your UX bug ==<br/>Speaker:    Fabiana Simões<br/>Blog:       http://fabianapsimoes.wordpress.com/<br/>Twitter:    https://twitter.com/fabianapsimoes</p><p>Do not do this stuff:<br/>* Do not simply present a preferred solution, but describe a problem (a<br/>difficulty you are having, etc.)<br/>* Do not use &#8220;This sucks&#8221; idiom, not even hidden in false niceties like<br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s not user friendly&#8221;<br/>* Do not talk for majority, when you are not entitled to (&#8220;most users<br/>would like&#8221;)<br/>* Do not consider all UX issues as minor: an inability to do stuff is<br/>not a minor issue</p><p>What is actually interesting for the designer in a report?<br/>* What were you trying to do?<br/>* Why did you want to do it?<br/>* What did you do?<br/>* What happened?<br/>* What were your expectations?</p><p>More notes<br/>* Write as much as needed<br/>* Describe what you see, did and *how you felt*<br/>* Print screen is your friend!<br/>* *Give praise*</p><p>== Extreme containment measures: keeping bug reports under control ==<br/>Speaker:  Jean-Francois Fortin Tam<br/>Homepage: http://jeff.ecchi.ca<br/>Twitter:  https://twitter.com/nekohayo</p><p>Discussed the problem lot of OS projects are having: lot of useless<br/>(old, irrelevant, waiting for decision no one wants to make) bug/rfe<br/>reports in their bug tracking systems. Lots of food for thought about<br/>our own projects, internal or external. Clever applications of<br/>principles from personal productivity systems such as GTD and Inbox Zero<br/>for bug tracking.  </p><p>The talk was mostly an applied version of this blog post, which is worth<br/>reading:<br/>http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/10/08/reducing-our-core-apps-software-inventory/</p><footer><strong>Petr Muller</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>I particularly like the UX bug reporting guide lines. Need to take those into
account when reporting UI issues.</p>

<p>I still haven&#8217;t read the second blog post which also looks interesting although
not very applicable to me. After all I&#8217;m the person reporting bugs not the one
who decides what and when gets fixed.</p>
