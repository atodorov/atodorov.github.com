    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Block Store volumes are easy to use and expand but notoriously
hard to shrink once their size has grown. Here is my tip for shrinking EBS size
and saving some money from over-provisioned storage. I&#8217;m assuming that you want to
shrink the root volume which is on EBS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write down the block device name for the root volume (/dev/sda1) - <em>from AWS console:
Instances; Select instance; Look at Details tab; See Root device or Block devices</em>;</li>
<li>Write down the availability zone of your instance - <em>from AWS console: Instances;
column Availability Zone</em>;</li>
<li>Stop instance;</li>
<li>Create snapshot of the root volume;</li>
<li>From the snapshot, create a second volume, in the <strong>same availability zone</strong> as
your instance (you will have to attach it later). This will be your pristine source;</li>
<li>Create new empty EBS volume (not based on a snapshot), with smaller size,
in the same availability zone - <em>from AWS console: Volumes; Create Volume;
Snapshot == No Snapshot</em>; <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - size should be large enough to hold
all the files from the source file system (try <code>df -h</code> on the source first);</li>
<li>Attach both volumes to instance while taking note of the block devices names
you assign for them in the AWS console;</li>
</ul>


<p>For example: In my case <code>/dev/sdc1</code> is the source snapshot and <code>/dev/sdd1</code> is the
empty target.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start instance;</li>
<li>Optionally check the source file system with <code>e2fsck -f /dev/sdc1</code>;</li>
<li>Create a file system for the empty volume - <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd1</code>;</li>
<li>Mount volumes at <code>/source</code> and <code>/target</code> respectively;</li>
<li>Now sync the files: <code>rsync -aHAXxSP /source/ /target</code>. <strong>Note the missing slash (/)
after <code>/target</code></strong>. If you add it you will end up with files inside <code>/target/source/</code>
which you don&#8217;t want;</li>
<li>Quickly verify the new directory structure with <code>ls -l /target</code>;</li>
<li>Unmount <code>/target</code>;</li>
<li>Optionally check the new file system for consistency <code>e2fsck -f /dev/sdd1</code>;</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - check how <code>/boot/grub/grub.conf</code> specifies the root volume -
by UUID, by LABEL, by device name, etc. You will have to duplicate the same for the
new smaller volume or update <code>/target/boot/grub/grub.conf</code> to match the new volume.
Check <code>/target/etc/fstab</code> as well!</li>
</ul>


<p>In my case I had to <code>e2label /dev/sdd1 /</code> because both <code>grub.conf</code> and <code>fstab</code> were
using the device label.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shutdown the instance;</li>
<li>Detach all volumes;</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - attach the new smaller volume to the instance using the same block device
name from the first step (e.g. <code>/dev/sda1</code>);</li>
<li>Start the instance and verify it is working correctly;</li>
<li>DELETE auxiliary volumes and snapshots so they don&#8217;t take space and accumulate costs!</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-03T22:54:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/02/03/fosdem-2014-report-day-2-testing-and-automation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/fosdem/2014/testing_automation.jpg" title="Testing and Automation" alt="Testing and Automation" /></p>

<p>FOSDEM was hosting the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">Testing and automation devroom</a>
for the second year and this was the very reason I attended the conference. I managed to get in
early and stayed until 15:00 when I had to leave to catch my flight (which was late :().</p>

<p>There were 3 talks given by Red Hat employees in the testing devroom which was a nice opportunity
to meet some of the folks I&#8217;ve been working on IRC with. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t meet anyone from
Fedora QA. Not sure if they were attending or not.</p>

<p>All the talks were interesting so see the official schedule and video for more details. I will
highlight only the items I saw as particularly interesting or have not heard of before.</p>

<h2>ANSTE</h2>

<p>ANSTE - Advanced Network Service Testing Environment is a test infrastructure controller,
something like our own <a href="http://beaker-project.org/">Beaker</a> but designed to create complex
networking environments. I think it lacks many of the provisioning features built in Beaker
and integration with various hypervisors and bare-metal provisioning. What it seems to do better
(as far as I can tell from the talk) is to deploy virtual systems and create more complex network
configuration between them. Not something I will need in the near future but definitely worth
a look at.</p>

<h2>cwrap</h2>

<blockquote><p>cwrap is&#8230;</p><p>a set of tools to create a fully isolated network environment to test client/server components on a single host.<br/>It provides synthetic account information, hostname resolution and support for privilege separation.<br/>The heart of cwrap consists of three libraries you can preload to any executable.</p></blockquote>


<p>That one was the coolest technology I&#8217;ve seen so far although I may not need to use it at all,
hmmm maybe testing DHCP fits the case.</p>

<p>It evolved from the Samba project and takes advantage of the order in which
libraries are searched when resolving functions. When you preload the project libraries
to any executable they will override standard libc functions for working with sockets,
user accounts and privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The socket_wrapper library redirects networking sockets through local UNIX sockets and
gives you the ability to test applications which need privileged ports with a local developer
account.</p>

<p>The nss_wrapper library provides artificial information for user and group accounts,
network name resolution using a hosts file and loading and testing of NSS modules.</p>

<p>The uid_wrapper library allows uid switching as a normal user (e.g. fake root) and
supports user/group changing in the local thread using the syscalls (like glibc).</p>

<p>All of these wrapper libraries are controlled via environment variables and definitely
makes testing of daemons and networking applications easier.</p>

<h2>Testing Documentation</h2>

<p>That one was just scratching the surface of an entire branch of testing which I&#8217;ve not
even considered before. The talk also explains why it is hard to test documentation and
what possible solutions there are.</p>

<p>If you write user guides and technical articles which need to
stay current with the software this is definitely the place to start.</p>

<h2>Automation in the Foreman Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The last talk I&#8217;ve listened to. Definitely the best one from a general testing approach
point of view. Greg talked about starting with Foreman unit tests, then testing the merged PR,
then integration tests, then moving on to test the package build and then the resulting packages themselves.</p>

<p>These guys try to even test their own infrastructure (infra as code) and the test suites
they use to test everything else. It&#8217;s all about automation and the level of confidence
you have in the entire process.</p>

<p>I like the fact that no single testing approach can make you confident enough before shipping
the code and that they&#8217;ve taken into account changes which get introduced at various places
(e.g. 3rd party package upgrades, distro specific issues, infrastructure changes and such)</p>

<p>If I had to attend only one session it would have been this one. There are many things for me
to take back home and apply to my work on Fedora and RHEL.</p>

<p>If you find any of these topics remotely interesting I advise you to wait until FOSDEM video
team uploads the recordings and watch the entire session stream. I&#8217;m definitely missing a lot
of stuff which can&#8217;t be easily reproduced in text form.</p>

<p>You can also find my report of the first FOSDEM&#8217;14 day on Saturday

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As promised I&#8217;m starting catching up on blogging after being sick and traveling.
Here&#8217;s my report of what I saw and found interesting at this year&#8217;s
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/">FOSDEM</a> which was held the last weekend in Brussels.</p>

<p>On Friday evening I&#8217;ve tried to attend the FOSDEM beer event at Delirium Cafe but
had a bad luck. At 21:30 the place was already packed with people. I managed to get
access to only one of the rooms but it looked like the wrong one :(. I think the space
is definitely small for all who are willing to attend.</p>

<p>During Saturday morning I did a quick sight-seeing most notably
<a href="www.migsworldwines.be/">Mig&#8217;s wine shop</a> and the area around it since I&#8217;ve never
been to this part of the city before. Then I took off to FOSDEM arriving at noon
(IOW not too late).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent most of my day at building K where project stands were and I stayed quite
a long time around the Python and Perl stands meeting new people and talking to them
about their upgrade practices and how they manage package dependencies
(aka promoting <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/fosdem/2014/fedora_octopus.jpg" title="Fedora Octopus" alt="Fedora Octopus" /></p>

<p>Fedora stand was busy with 3D printing this year. I&#8217;ve seen 3D printing
before but here I was amazed of the fine-grained quality of the pieces produced.
This is definitely something to have in mind if you are building physical products.</p>

<p>Red Hat&#8217;s presence was very strong this year. In addition to the numerous talks they
gave there were also oVirt and OpenShift Origin stands which were packed with people.
I couldn&#8217;t even get close to say hi or take a picture.</p>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/fosdem/2014/doudou_linux.png" alt="DoudouLinux" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"/></p>

<p>Near the end of the day I went to listen to some of the lightning talks. The ones that
I liked the most were MATE Desktop and DoudouLinux.</p>

<p>The thing about MATE which I liked
is that they have a <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-university">MATE University</a>
initiative which is targeting developers who want to learn how to develop MATE extensions.
This is pretty cool with respect to community and developers on-boarding.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.doudoulinux.org">DoudouLinux</a> is a Debian based distribution targeted at
small children (2 or 3 years old) based on simple desktop and educational activities.
I&#8217;ve met project leader and founder Jean-Michel Philippe who gave the talk. We chatted for
a while when Alejandro Simon from <a href="http://www.kano.me/">Kano</a> came around and showed us a prototype
of their computer for children. I will definitely give DoudouLinux a try and maybe pre-order Kano as well.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a Python beer event at Delirium and after that dinner at
Chez Leon where I had snails and rabbit with cherries in cherry beer sauce.
I&#8217;ve had a few beers with Marc-Andre from <a href="http://egenix.com">eGenix</a>
and Charlie from <a href="http://www.clark-consulting.eu/">Clark Consulting</a> and the talk
was mostly about non-technical stuff which was nice.</p>

<p>After that we went back to Delirium and
re-united with <a href="http://akurtakov.blogspot.com">Alexander Kurtakov</a> and other folks from
Red Hat for more cherry beer!</p>

<p>Report of the second day of FOSDEM&#8217;14 on Sunday is

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/01/28/book-review-january-2014/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T23:16:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/01/28/book-review-january-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for not being able to write anything this month. I&#8217;ve been very sick
and hardly even touched a computer in the last few weeks. I promise to make
it up to you next month. Until then here&#8217;s the books I&#8217;ve managed to read in
January.</p>

<h2>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1erRrnb">Hooked</a> is an ebook for Kindle which I luckily got for
free on NYE (it&#8217;s paid now). The book describes the so called &#8220;Hook Model&#8221;
which is a guide to building products people can’t put down.</p>

<p>The book goes through a cycle of <strong>trigger</strong>, <strong>action</strong>, <strong>variable reward</strong> and
<strong>investment</strong> to describe how one can design a product which users keep using
without you doing anything (pretty much). There are plenty of examples with products
like Instagram and Pinterest.</p>

<p>I really find the book interesting and will strongly recommend it as a must read
to anyone who is building a product. If you&#8217;re thinking about a mobile app or an
online service this book is definitely for you.</p>

<h2>CyberJoly Drim</h2>

<p><a href="http://hell.pl/nina/carramba.htm">CyberJoly Drim</a> is a 1998 cyber punk story by
Polish writer Antonina Liedtke. One I&#8217;ve heard about through the years but found
just recently. It&#8217;s about a love story although everything else is fiction. PDF format
is around 30 pages.</p>

<p>I found it hard to read especially b/c my Polish is totally rusty (not to mention I hardly
understand it) and Google translate didn&#8217;t manage well neither. Anyway, not a bad read
before bed time if you like this kind of stuff.</p>

<h2>The First in Bulgarian Internet</h2>

<p>Last a book about
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13398350">Bulgarian Internet pioneers</a>. The book
compiles a great deal with historical data as well as interviews and web site descriptions.
It&#8217;s said to mention about 400 persons.</p>

<p>The events start around 1989 with the BBS systems at the time and the first one to appear in
the country with accounts of first time logging into the network and pretty much seeing a
computer. Then it goes to tell the story of first companies and Internet providers, how they
started business, how they grew and formed the country&#8217;s backbone infrastructure. There&#8217;s
lots of personal memories and stories as well. This goes to about 2002 when the book
was written.</p>

<p>The second part of the book mostly describes various websites, some of the first ones and
some milestone or famous ones. It&#8217;s organized by date of website launch but isn&#8217;t that much
interesting. I find the local contents at the time a bit boring.</p>

<p>The book isn&#8217;t what I initially expected - I wanted more personal stories and more news from
the kitchen. It&#8217;s not that, it looks to me the people who were interviewed had chosen their
words very carefully and didn&#8217;t reveal any sensational stories.</p>

<p>The nice thing about all of that is I&#8217;ve started using the web in early 1998 and remember
most of the events and websites described in the book. It&#8217;s good to remember the history.
I own the book and can give it to you if you like. It&#8217;s on the <a href="http://atodorov.org/give-away/">Give Away</a>
list.</p>

<p>I hope you find something interesting to read in my library. If not please share what did you
read this month.</p>

<hr />

<p>PS: I&#8217;m currently in Milan and will be visiting FOSDEM at the end of the week. Catch
you there if you&#8217;re coming.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Book Review of 2013]]></title>
    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/01/02/book-review-of-2013/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-02T10:07:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2014/01/02/book-review-of-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year everyone! I was able to complete reading a few books in the last
days so this first post will be a quick review of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16191345-alexander-todorov?read_at=2013&amp;view=covers">all twelve books I&#8217;ve read in 2013</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical Blogging</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve started the year with
<a href="http://amzn.to/1a2QySD">Technical Blogging: Turn Your Expertise into a Remarkable Online Presence</a>
by Antonio Cangiano. This is the book which prompted me to start this blog. It is
targeted primarily at technical blogging but could be useful to non-tech bloggers as well.
I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is writing for the web.</p>

<h2>The 4-Hour Workweek</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1ivu2q4">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a>
by Timothy Ferriss. This book I found at a local
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/01/30/startup-talk-5-book-list/">start-up event</a> and is one of my
all time favorites. The basic idea is to ditch the traditional working space and
work less utilizing more automation. This is something I&#8217;ve been doing to an extent
during the last 5+ years and I am still changing my life and working habits to
reach the moment where I work only a few hours a week.</p>

<p>A must read for any entrepreneur, freelancer or work from home folks.</p>

<h2>The E-Myth Revisited</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1d0j5ee">The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don&#8217;t Work and What to Do About It</a>
by Michael Gerber is the second book I&#8217;ve found at the same start-up event mentioned
previously. I found this one particularly hard to read. What I took from it was
that you should think about your business as a franchise and document processes
so that others can do it for you in the same way you would do it yourself.</p>

<h2>Culture and Wine</h2>

<p>Next two books are in Bulgarian and can be found at my
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16191345-alexander-todorov?read_at=2013&amp;view=covers">Goodreads list</a>.
They are about culture and religion and wine tasting 101.</p>

<h2>Accelerando</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/19Ctnk8">Accelerando (Singularity)</a> by Charles Stross is also one
of my favorites. I&#8217;ve heard about it at a local CloudFoundry conference a few years
back and finally had the time to read it. This is a fiction book where events start
in the near future and drive forward to dismantling the planets in the Solar system,
uploading lobsters minds on the Internet, space travel, aliens and family
relationships. I will definitely recommend it, the book is a very relaxing read.</p>

<h2>DevOps</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1eXk3JN">What Is DevOps?</a> by Mike Loukides and
<a href="http://amzn.to/19KobFn">Building a DevOps Culture</a> by Mandi Walls are two short
free books for Kindle. They just touch base on the topic of DevOps and what it
takes to create a DevOps organization. Definitely worth reading even if you&#8217;re
not deeply interested in this topic.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1dVvQmE">DevOps for Developers</a> by Michael Huttermann is a
practical books about DevOps. It talks about processes and tools and lists
lots of examples. The tools part is Ruby centric though.
I found it a bit hard to read at times and it took me a while
to complete it. I&#8217;m not sure if the book is really helpful if one decides to
change an exiting organization to a DevOps like structure but it is definitely
a starting point.</p>

<p>The days of waterfall software development are gone and knowingly or not most of
us work in a DevOps like environment these days. I think it&#8217;s worth at least skimming
through this book and taking some essentials from it.</p>

<h2>UX For Lean Startups</h2>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a> by Laura Klein is a very good book
about designing user experience and validation which I&#8217;ve
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/">reviewed previously</a>.
I strongly recommend this book to everyone who is building a product of some sort.</p>

<h2>Bulgarian Comics</h2>

<p>At the end of the year I&#8217;ve managed to read two comics books, both in Bulgarian.
The first one is a brief history of the comics arts in the country in the past 150
years with lots of references to good old stories which I&#8217;ve read when I was a kid.</p>

<p>The second one is a special edition (ebook only, print edition is out of stock) of
the popular Daga (Rainbow) magazine which ceased to exist 20 years ago. There are
some new episodes of the old stories drawn by the original artists.</p>

<p>Both books seem to be a turning point in Bulgarian comics art and market. Hopefully
we&#8217;ll see more cool stuff in the future. These books are not available on Amazon
but there are some <a href="http://amzn.to/19Cw6tV">free comics books for Kindle</a> which
you may give a try.</p>

<p>I hope you find something interesting to read in my list. Also feel free to comment
and share your favorite books in the comments below.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Upstream Test Suite Status of Fedora 20]]></title>
    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-24T08:01:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/24/upstream-test-suite-status-of-fedora-20</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I&#8217;ve expressed my thoughts about the state of
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-December/119637.html">upstream test suites in Fedora</a>
along with some other ideas. Following the response on this thread I&#8217;m starting
to analyze all SRPM packages in Fedora 20 in order to establish a baseline. Here are my initial findings.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Inside</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve found two source distributions for Fedora 20:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>Fedora-20-source-DVD.iso</code> file which to my knowledge contains the sources
of all packages that comprise the installation media;</li>
<li>The <code>Everything/source/SRPMS/</code> directory which appears to contain the sources
of everything else available in the Fedora 20 repositories.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are <strong>2574</strong> SRPM packages in Fedora-20 source DVD and <strong>14364</strong> SRPMs
in the Everything/ directory. 9,2G vs. 41G.</p>

<h2>Test Suite Execution In %check</h2>

<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Test_Suites">Fedora Packaging Guidelines</a>
state</p>

<blockquote><p>If the source code of the package provides a test suite,<br/>it should be executed in the %check section,<br/>whenever it is practical to do so.</p></blockquote>


<p>In my research I found <strong>738</strong> SRPMs on the DVD which have a %check
section and <strong>4838</strong> such packages under <code>Everything/</code>. This is <strong>28,6%</strong> and <strong>33,6%</strong>
respectively.</p>

<h2>Test Suite Existence</h2>

<p>A quick grep for either <code>test/</code> or <code>tests/</code> directories in the package sources revealed
<strong>870</strong> SRPM packages in the source DVD which are very likely to have a test suite.
This is <strong>33,8%</strong>. <strike>I wasn&#8217;t able to inspect the <code>Everything/</code> directory with this script
because it takes too long to execute and my system crashed out of memory.
I will update this post later with that info.</strike></p>

<p><em>UPDATE 2014-01-02</em>:
In the <code>Everything/</code> directory only <strong>4481</strong> (<strong>31,2%</strong>) SRPM packages appear to have
test suites.</p>

<p>The scripts and raw output are available at <a href="https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts">https://github.com/atodorov/fedora-scripts</a>.</p>

<p>So it looks like on average <strong>30%</strong> of the packages execute their test suites at build
time in the %check section and less than <strong>35%</strong> have test suites at all!
There&#8217;s definitely room for improvement and I plan to focus on this during 2014!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on open-sourcing <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> I needed to remove
all hard-coded URL references from the templates. My solution was to essentially
inherit from the standard <code>{% url %}</code> template tag. Here is how to do it.</p>

<h2>Background History</h2>

<p>Difio is not hosted on a single server. Parts of the website are static HTML,
hosted on Amazon S3. Other parts are dynamic - hosted on OpenShift. It&#8217;s also
possible but not required at the moment to host at various PaaS providers for
redundancy and simple load balancing.</p>

<p>As an easy fix I had hard-coded some URLs to link to the static S3 pages and others
go link to my PaaS provider.</p>

<p>I needed a simple solution which can be extended to allow for multiple domain hosting.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The solution I came up with is to override the standard <code>{% url %}</code>
tag and use it everywhere in my templates. The new tag will produce absolute URLs containing
the specified protocol plus domain name and view path. For this to work you have to
inherit the standard <code>URLNode</code> class and override the <code>render()</code> method to include the new
values.</p>

<p>You also need to register a tag method to utilize the new class. My approach was to use
the existing <code>url()</code> method to do all background processing and simply casting the result
object to the new class.</p>

<p>All code is available at <a href="https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/3013/">https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/3013/</a>.</p>

<p>To use in your templates simply add</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{% load fqdn_url from fqdn_url %}
</span><span class='line'>&lt;a href="{% fqdn_url 'dashboard' %}">Dashboard&lt;/a></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/18/can-i-use-android-phone-as-smart-card-reader/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-18T23:09:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/18/can-i-use-android-phone-as-smart-card-reader</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had troubles with my Omnikey CardMan 6121 smart card reader.
For some reason it will not detect the card inside and was unusable.
<code>/var/log/messages</code> was filled with  <em>Card Not Powered</em> messages:</p>

<pre><code>Dec 18 11:17:55 localhost pcscd: eventhandler.c:292:EHStatusHandlerThread() Error powering up card: -2146435050 0x80100016
Dec 18 11:18:01 localhost pcscd: winscard.c:368:SCardConnect() Card Not Powered
Dec 18 11:18:02 localhost pcscd: winscard.c:368:SCardConnect() Card Not Powered
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/omnikey_cardman_6121.gif" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found the solution in
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531998">RHBZ #531998</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve found the problem, and it&#8217;s purely mechanical.<br/>Omnikey has simply screwed up when they designed this reader.<br/>When the reader is inserted into the ExpressCard slot, it gets slightly<br/>compressed. This is enough to trigger the mechanical switch that detects<br/>insertions. If I jam something in there and force it apart, then pcscd<br/>starts reporting that the slot is empty.</p><footer><strong>Pierre Ossman</strong> <cite><a href='https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531998#c12'>Comment #12</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>So I tried moving the smart card a millimeter back and forth inside the reader and
that fixed it for me.</p>

<p>This smart card is standard SIM size and I wonder if it is possible to use
<a href="http://amzn.to/1dnl2gN">dual SIM</a> smart phones and <a href="http://amzn.to/18XpWlp">tablets</a>
as a reader? I will be happy to work on the software side if there is an open source
project already (e.g. OpenSC + drivers for Android). If not, why not?</p>

<p>If you happen to have information on the subject please share it in the comments.
Thanks!</p>

    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/11/idempotent-django-email-sender-with-amazon-sqs-and-memcache</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I wrote about my problem with
<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/06/duplicate-amazon-sqs-messages-cause-multiple-emails/">duplicate Amazon SQS messages causing multiple emails</a>
for <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>. After considering several options and
feedback from
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/409429840820199424">@Answers4AWS</a>
I wrote a small decorator to fix this.</p>

<p>It uses the cache backend to prevent the task from executing twice
during the specified time frame. The code is available at
<a href="https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/3010/">https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/3010/</a>.</p>

<p>As stated on Twitter you should use Memcache (or ElastiCache) for this.
If using Amazon S3 with my
<a href="https://github.com/atodorov/django-s3-cache">django-s3-cache</a> don&#8217;t use the
<code>us-east-1</code> region because it is eventually consistent.</p>

<p>The solution is fast and simple on the development side and uses my existing
cache infrastructure so it doesn&#8217;t cost anything more!</p>

<p>There is still a race condition between marking the message as processed
and the second check but nevertheless this should minimize the possibility of
receiving duplicate emails to an accepted level. Only time will tell though!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-09T10:09:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/1fi1KeE">UX for Lean Startups</a>
and strongly recommend this book to anyone who is <strong>OR</strong> wants to be an
entrepreneur. Here is a short review of the book.</p>

<p>This book is for anyone who is creating a product/service or is considering the
idea of doing so. It talks about validation, interaction design and subsequent
product measurement and iteration. The book demonstrates some techniques and tools
to validate, design and measure your business ideas and products.
Its goal is to teach you how to design products that deliver fantastic user
experience, e.g. ones that are intuitive and easy to use.
It has nothing to do with visual design.</p>

<p>The author Laura Klein summarizes the book as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>User research<br/>    Listen to your users. All the time. I mean it.</p><p>Validation<br/>    When you make assumptions or create hypotheses,<br/>    test them before spending lots of time building products around them.</p><p>Design<br/>    Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p></blockquote>


<h2>Early Validation</h2>

<p>This chapter helped me a lot to understand what exactly is validation and how
to go about it. The flow is validating the problem you are trying to solve,
then the market and then the product.</p>

<p>I will also add that by using some of these research techniques around a
vague idea/area of interest you may come around a particular trend/pattern or problem
and develop your business from there.</p>

<blockquote><p>You’ll know that you’ve validated a problem when you start to hear<br/>particular groups of people complaining about something specific.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Your goal in validating your market is to begin to narrow down the<br/>group of people who will want their problems solved badly enough to buy<br/>your product. Your secondary goal is to understand exactly why they’re<br/>interested so you can find other markets that might be similarly motivated.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>You’ll know that you’ve successfully validated your market when you can<br/>accurately predict that a particular type of person will have a specific<br/>problem and that the problem will be severe enough that that person is<br/>interested in purchasing a solution.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Just because you have discovered a real problem and have a group of people<br/>willing to pay you to solve their problem, that doesn’t necessarily mean that<br/>your product is the right solution. </p><p>&#8230;</p><p>You’ll know that you’ve validated your product when a large percentage of<br/>your target market offers to pay you money to solve their problem.</p></blockquote>


<h2>User Research</h2>

<p>Next few chapters talk about user research, the various kinds of it and when/how
to perform it. It talks how to properly run surveys, how to ask good questions,
etc.</p>

<h2>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research</h2>

<blockquote><p>Quantitative research is about measuring what real people are actually<br/>doing with your product. It doesn’t involve speaking with specific humans.<br/>It’s about the data in aggregate. It should always be statistically significant.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Quantitative research tells you **what** your problem is. Qualitative<br/>research tells you **why** you have that problem.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>If you want to measure something that exists, like traffic or revenue or how<br/>many people click on a particular button, then you want quantitative data.<br/>If you want to know why you lose people out of your purchase funnel or<br/>why people all leave once they hit a specific page, or why people seem not<br/>to click that button, then you need qualitative.</p></blockquote>


<h2>Part Two: Design</h2>

<p>The second part of this book talks about design - everything from building a
prototype to figuring out when you don’t want one. It assumes you have validated
the initial idea and now move on to designing the product and validating that
design before you start building it. It talks about diagrams, sketches, wireframes,
prototypes and of course MVPs.</p>

<p>I think you can safely skip some of these steps when it comes to small applications
because it may be easier/faster to build the application instead of a prototype.
Definitely not to be skipped if you&#8217;re building a more complex product!</p>

<h2>Part Three: Product</h2>

<p>This section talks about metrics and measuring the product once it is out of the door.
Supposedly based on these metrics you will refine your design and update the product
accordingly.  Most of the time it focuses on A/B testing and which metrics are
important and which are so called &#8220;vanity metrics&#8221;.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the examples of A/B testing and explanations what it is good for
and what it does poorly. Definitely a mistake I&#8217;ve happened to made myself. I&#8217;m sure you too.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have read this book and what your thoughts are. Thanks!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/06/duplicate-amazon-sqs-messages-cause-multiple-emails/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-06T22:47:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/12/06/duplicate-amazon-sqs-messages-cause-multiple-emails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beware if using Amazon Simple Queue Service to send email messages!
Sometime SQS messages are duplicated which results in multiple copies of
the messages being sent. This happened today at <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>
and is really annoying to users. In this post I will explain why there is no easy
way of fixing it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Q: Can a deleted message be received again?</p><p>Yes, under rare circumstances you might receive a previously deleted message again.<br/>This can occur in the rare situation in which a DeleteMessage operation doesn&#8217;t<br/>delete all copies of a message because one of the servers in the distributed<br/>Amazon SQS system isn&#8217;t available at the time of the deletion. That message copy<br/>can then be delivered again. You should design your application so that no errors<br/>or inconsistencies occur if you receive a deleted message again.</p><footer><strong>Amazon FAQ</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>In my case the cron scheduler logs say:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;AsyncResult: a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While on the worker nodes the logs say:</p>

<pre><code>[2013-12-06 10:13:06,229: INFO/MainProcess] Got task from broker: tasks.cron_monthly_email_reminder[a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a]
[2013-12-06 10:18:09,456: INFO/MainProcess] Got task from broker: tasks.cron_monthly_email_reminder[a9e5a73a-4d4a-4995-a91c-90295e27100a]
</code></pre>

<p>This clearly shows the same message (see the UUID) has been processed twice!
This resulted in hundreds of duplicate emails :(.</p>

<h2>Why This Is Hard To Fix</h2>

<p>There are two basic approaches to solve this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check some log files or database for previous record of the message having
been processed;</li>
<li>Use idempotent operations that if you process the message again, you
get the same results, and that those results don&#8217;t create duplicate files/records.</li>
</ul>


<p>The problem with checking for duplicate messages is:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a race condition between marking the message as processed and the
second check;</li>
<li>You need to use some sort of locking mechanism to safe-guard against the race condition;</li>
<li>In the event of an eventual consistency of the log/DB you can&#8217;t guarantee that
the previous attempt will show up and so can&#8217;t guarantee that you won&#8217;t process
the message twice.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above don&#8217;t seem to work well for distributed applications not to mention
Difio processes millions of messages per month, per node and the logs are quite big.</p>

<p>The second option is to have control of the Message-Id or some other email header
so that the second message will be discarded either at the server (Amazon SES in my case)
or at the receiving MUA. I like this better but I don&#8217;t think it is technically possible
with the current environment. Need to check though.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve asked AWS support to look into
<a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=140782">this thread</a> and hopefully
they will have some more hints. If you have any other ideas please post in the comments!
Thanks!</p>

<p>The code above works fine with curl-7.27 or older while it breaks with curl-7.29 and
newer. As explained by
<a href="http://lists.baseurl.org/pipermail/yum-devel/2013-November/010428.html">Zdenek Pavlas</a>
the reason is an internal change in libcurl which doesn&#8217;t accept a value of 1 anymore!</p>

<p>The bug is reproducible with a newer libcurl version and a vanilla urlgrabber==3.9.1
from PyPI (e.g. inside a virtualenv). The latest python-urlgrabber RPM packages in both
Fedora and Amazon Linux already have the fix.</p>

<p>I have tested the patch proposed by Zdenek and it works for me. I still have no idea why
there aren&#8217;t any updates released on PyPI though!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://atodorov.org/images/fedora/beaker.png" title="Beaker test lab" alt="&quot;Beaker test lab&quot;" /></p>

<p>In the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been working together with
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tflink">Tim Flink</a> and
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Kparal">Kamil Paral</a> from the Fedora QA
team on bringing some installation testing expertise to Fedora and establishing
an <a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/">open source test lab</a>
to perform automated testing in. The infrastructure is
already in relatively usable condition so I&#8217;ve decided to share this information
with the community.</p>

<h2>Beaker is Running Our Test Lab</h2>

<p><a href="http://beaker-project.org/">Beaker</a> is the software suite that powers the test
lab infrastructure. It is quite complex, with many components and sometimes not
very straight-forward to set up. Tim has been working on that with me giving it
a try and reporting issues as they have been discovered and fixed.</p>

<p>In the process of working on this I&#8217;ve managed to create
<a href="http://gerrit.beaker-project.org/#/q/owner:%22Alexander+Todorov%22,n,z">couple of patches</a>
against Beaker and friends. They are still pending release in a future version
because of more urgent bug fixes which need to released first.</p>

<h2>SNAKE is The Kickstart Template Server</h2>

<p><a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> is a client/server Python framework used
to support Anaconda installations. It supports plain text ks.cfg files, IIRC those
were static templates, no variable substitution.</p>

<p>The other possibility is Python templates based on Pykickstart:</p>

<p>At the moment SNAKE is essentially abandoned but feature complete.
I&#8217;m thinking about adopting the project just in case we need to make some fixes.
Will let you know more about this when it happens.</p>

<h2>Open Source Test Suite</h2>

<p>I have been working on opening up several test cases for what we (QE) call
a tier #1 installation test suite. They can be found in
<a href="http://taskbot.cloud.fedoraproject.org/cgit/fedora-beaker-tests/">git</a>.
The tests are base on <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/beakerlib/">beakerlib</a> and
the legacy RHTS framework which is now part of Beaker.</p>

<p>This effort has been coordinated with Kamil as part of a pilot
project he&#8217;s responsible for. I&#8217;ve been executing the same test suite against
earlier Fedora 20 snapshots but using an internal environment. Now everything
is going out in the open.</p>

<h2>Executing The Tests</h2>

<p>Well you can&#8217;t do that - YET! There are command line client tools for Fedora
but Beaker and SNAKE are not well suited for use outside a restricted network
like LAN or VPN. There are issues with authentication most notably for SNAKE.</p>

<p>At the moment I have to ssh through two different systems to get proper access.
However this is been worked on. I&#8217;ve read about a rewrite which will allow Beaker
to utilize a custom authentication framework like FAS for example. Hopefully that
will be implemented soon enough.</p>

<p>I will also like to see the test systems have direct access to the Internet for
various reasons but this is not without its risks either. This is still to be
decided.</p>

<p>If you are interested anyway see the <code>kick-tests.sh</code> file in the test suite for
examples and command line options.</p>

<h2>Test Results</h2>

<p>The first successfully completed
<a href="http://beaker.fedoraproject.org/bkr/jobs/">test jobs</a> are jobs 50 to 58.
There&#8217;s a failure in one of the test cases, namely SELinux related
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1027148">RHBZ #1027148</a>.</p>

<p>From what I can tell the lab is now working as expected and we can start doing
some testing against Fedora development snapshots.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/19/tip-cut-leading-or-trailing-fields-from-strings-in-bash/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-19T00:16:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/19/tip-cut-leading-or-trailing-fields-from-strings-in-bash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was looking for a command sequence to cut a string in two by predefined
delimiter (e.g. like <code>cut</code> does). I wanted to get the last field only and all
fields but the last as separate variables.</p>

<p>The proposed solutions I&#8217;ve found suggested using <code>awk</code> but I don&#8217;t like it.
Here&#8217;s a simple solution using <code>cut</code> and <code>rev</code> which can extract arbitrary
field counts from the end of the string.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f1 -d. | rev
org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f-2 -d. | rev
fedoraproject.org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f-3 -d. | rev
phx2.fedoraproject.org
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f2- -d. | rev
buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f3- -d. | rev
buildvm-08.phx2
$ echo 'buildvm-08.phx2.fedoraproject.org' | rev | cut -f4- -d. | rev
buildvm-08
</code></pre>

<p>The magic here is done by <code>rev</code> which reverses the order of characters in every
line. It comes with the <em>util-linux-ng</em> package.</p>

<p><strong>Note to Self:</strong> <em>util-linux-ng</em> appears to contain more useful commands which
I wasn&#8217;t aware of. Need to RTFM a little bit.</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/13/keeping-backwards-compatibility-for-pykickstart/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-13T23:59:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/11/13/keeping-backwards-compatibility-for-pykickstart</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/snake/">SNAKE</a> templates as part of my
installation testing work;</li>
<li>SNAKE has a dependency on pykickstart;</li>
<li>To test the latest and greatest kickstart features in Fedora we need the
latest version of pykickstart;</li>
<li>Latest pykickstart needs Python 2.7</li>
<li>Python 2.7 is not available on RHEL 6 which is used to host the test
infrastructure.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just yesterday I hit an issue with the above setup and figured Fedora QA is
in a kind of strange situation - we always need the latest but need it
conservative enough to run on RHEL 6. See the original thread at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/kickstart-list/2013-November/msg00001.html">kickstart-list</a>.</p>

<p>In this particular case the solution will be to remove the offending code
and implement the same functionality in backward-compatible manner. Also add
more tests. I will be working on this tomorrow (there&#8217;s an older patch already).</p>

<p>The BIG question remains though - how do you manage software evolution and still
keep it compatible with older execution stacks? Please share your experience in
the comments section.</p>

<hr />

<p>PP: Spoiler - this is part of an ongoing effort to bring open source installation
testing expertise (my domain) into Fedora world, plus establish a community supported
test infrastructure. More info TBA soon.</p>

<a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/">During the previous edition</a> of the hackathon
I gave one team a special personal gift based on my estimation of their hacker level!
Thanks to <a href="http://blog.ganev.bg">Vihren Ganev</a> (one of the gift winners) for reminding
me about that!</p>

<p>This year I have even bigger items to give to those who think out of the box, who hack
their way around and are brave enough to try and change the world through software!
I have one
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWCS52/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AWCS52&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20">Lenovo Thinkpad Business Backpack</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001AWCS52" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and one

(a bit bigger than the one on Amazon, easily fits a BlackBerry Z10) as seen on the pictures below.
Plus some small Red Hat branded items.</p>

<h2>How To Get The Gifts</h2>

<p>There are no rules, I will make a decision as I go along.
I can give away all items or none. It&#8217;s up to you! Surprise me!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be mentoring the teams who decided to work with Django but
I&#8217;m happy to talk to anyone who needs help or just wants to grab the
cool stuff! See you there!</p>

    <link href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/13/tip-extending-btrfs-filesystem-for-fedora-virtual-machine/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-13T14:53:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/10/13/tip-extending-btrfs-filesystem-for-fedora-virtual-machine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was testing Fedora 20 inside a KVM guest this week when the disk
space run out. The system was configured to use Btrfs filesystem and this is how
to extend it.</p>

<p>First you have to extend the underlying guest storage. On the host I&#8217;m using LVM
so this is a no brainer:</p>

<pre><code># pvs
  PV                                                    VG              Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
  /dev/mapper/luks-f3f6cea1-baba-4aaf-bca8-33a0ec540369 vg_redbull_mini lvm2 a--  289,11g 134,11g

# lvs
  LV            VG              Attr      LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  vm_fedora     vg_redbull_mini -wi-ao---  15,00g                                             

# lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/vg_redbull_mini-vm_fedora 
  Extending logical volume vm_fedora to 20,00 GiB
  Logical volume vm_fedora successfully resized

# lvs
  LV            VG              Attr      LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  vm_fedora     vg_redbull_mini -wi-ao---  20,00g                                             

# pvs
  PV                                                    VG              Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
  /dev/mapper/luks-f3f6cea1-baba-4aaf-bca8-33a0ec540369 vg_redbull_mini lvm2 a--  289,11g 129,11g
</code></pre>

<p>On the VM we have a default Btrfs layout:</p>

<pre><code># blkid
/dev/vda1: UUID="410ee563-e701-42ff-9d5f-5805dd103e35" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="0000330f-01" 
/dev/vda2: UUID="f4addad4-a0fc-482e-ad5a-240864b76f09" TYPE="swap" PARTUUID="0000330f-02" 
/dev/vda3: LABEL="fedora" UUID="f0b589ce-061c-4ac3-826e-7f3f8c8a6d30" UUID_SUB="11aa8414-3ce1-4fe7-a506-9a4f91ba5c30" TYPE="btrfs" PARTUUID="0000330f-03" 

# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda3        13G   11G  1.4G  89% /
devtmpfs        996M     0  996M   0% /dev
tmpfs          1002M   80K 1002M   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs          1002M  668K 1002M   1% /run
tmpfs          1002M     0 1002M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs          1002M   16K 1002M   1% /tmp
/dev/vda3        13G   11G  1.4G  89% /home
/dev/vda1       477M   72M  376M  17% /boot
</code></pre>

<p>Now power-off (not reboot) and power-on the VM guest so that it sees the new size
of the underlying storage. See the fdisk header (line 9 below), vda is now 20GiB!</p>

<p>Before extending the filesystem you have to extend the underlying disk partition! This is the
trickiest part. Using fdisk or parted you have to delete the partition and add it again.
Make sure to use the <strong>SAME</strong> starting sector for the new partition (line 33)!</p>

<p>See lines 36 and 49 above. The new partition has a greater size.
After reboot just resize the filesystem and verify the new space has been added</p>

<pre><code># btrfs filesystem resize max /
Resize '/' of 'max'

# df -h

<p>This is it, more disk space available for the virtual machine. Let me know how it works

<p>Every once in a while ABRT will tell you that reporting is disabled because
backtrace is unusable. What it means is that it can&#8217;t read some of the debugging
symbols and the most likely reason for that is debuginfo packages are missing.</p>

<p>To install them first locate the directory containing the files for that particular
crash. Use the <code>executable</code> file to find out if you are looking into the correct
directory. Then use this one liner to install the missing debuginfo packages.</p>

<pre><code># pwd
/var/tmp/abrt/ccpp-2013-10-10-15:55:18-15533
# cat backtrace | grep lib | tr -s ' ' | cut -f4 -d' ' | sort | uniq | grep "/" | xargs rpm -qf --qf "%{name}\n" | xargs debuginfo-install -y

<p>Here is my summary of the second Fedora Test Day hosted at
<a href="http://initlab.org">init Lab</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Local attendance was a total disaster, in fact I was testing once again by my own.
This time
there were more people in the lab, all busy with their daily routines and tasks.
There were no people who came for the testing :(. I will have to try different
venues in the future and see if the situation improves.</p>

<p>On the testing front I managed to score 5 bugs against
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=709797,709799,709806,709810">GNOME</a>
and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017807">Fedora</a>.
You can see the other test results and bugs on the
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-10_Gnome_3.10">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>There are two things I didn&#8217;t like in particular</p>

<ul>
<li>GNOME 3 as well as its classic mode - simply not the environment I&#8217;m used to;</li>
<li>Having to record test results in the wiki! I&#8217;m
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2013-October/118284.html">writing</a>
to the Fedora QA mailing list about that as we speak.</li>
</ul>


<p>At one time I was engaged in a discussion about which Bulgarian keyboard layout
should be the default in GNOME simply because of
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709799">GNOME #709799</a>. The default
keyboard layout will be Bulgarian (traditional phonetic) aka bg+phonetic.</p>

<blockquote><p>(16,13,26) rtcm: atodorov: are you bulgarian and/or live in bulgaria?<br/>(16,14,20) rtcm: atodorov: if yes, I wanted to know which keyboard layout most people expect there to be the default<br/>(16,16,34) atodorov: rtcm: I&#8217;m a Bulgarian, however I can&#8217;t tell which one. Both Phonetic and standard (BDS) are common<br/>(16,16,54) atodorov: a safe bet is to go with phonetic I guess. <br/>(16,19,46) rtcm: atodorov: can you tell me which one is it in XKB terms? is it &#8220;bg&#8221;, &#8220;bg+bas_phonetic&#8221; or &#8220;bg+phonetic&#8221; ?<br/>(16,20,51) rtcm: they&#8217;re labeled as &#8220;Bulgarian&#8221;, &#8220;Bulgarian (new phonetic)&#8221; and &#8220;Bulgarian (traditional phonetic)&#8221;<br/>(16,21,30) atodorov: bg+phonetic is the traditional phonetic<br/>(16,22,04) atodorov: bg labeled as &#8220;Bulgarian&#8221; is the standard one I guess. Here we call it BDS after the standardization institute<br/>(16,22,34) atodorov: bg+bas_phonetic is created from the Bulgarian Academy of Science and is not very popular as far as I know. I&#8217;ve never seen it in use<br/>(16,23,15) rtcm: atodorov: all I want to know is what most people would expect? like what does windows do by default? that&#8217;s a good bet<br/>(16,27,46) atodorov: rtcm: I&#8217;m just being told that new Windows releases use yet another layout by default, which is like phonetic but with some characters in new places and people don&#8217;t like that<br/>(16,27,53) atodorov: my safe bet goes to bg+phonetic<br/>(16,29,05) rtcm: ok, thanks</p></blockquote>


<p>It is a rare occasion when you get to make a decision that affects a large group
of people and I hope you don&#8217;t hate me for that!</p>

<p>Do you want to see more Fedora Test Days happening in Sofia? Join me and I will
organize some more!</p>
