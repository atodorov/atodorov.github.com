  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m starting a new series where I will share my thoughts about software design,
usability and other related topics with examples of items I like or dislike.
I&#8217;ve
<a href="/blog/2013/05/30/why-vmware-multi-hypervisor-manager-architecture-is-wrong/">written before</a>
about the topic so consider this post as a sequel. I&#8217;m starting with couple of
examples from the mobile world. Plese use the comments to tell if there is something
that you particulary like or dislike in software or hardware design
(and apologies to my readers for not being able to post more frequently lately).</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Camera Burst Feature vs. Android</h2>

<p>BlackBerry 10 Camera&#8217;s burst mode is well made in my opinion. It is capable of
taking thousands of pictures and saving the to disk without interruption. Thus
I am capable of taking pictures of fast moving objects like flash lights.</p>

<p><img src="/images/flashlight.jpg" title="Flash light" alt="Flash light" /></p>

<p>On the other hand I have access to an
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=htc%20one&linkCode=ur2&tag=atodorovorg-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&linkId=CZ33VB6BARW7FWZS">HTC One smartphone</a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
with Android. The burst
mode feature there is particularly crappy. It shoots between 20 to 50 photos
(haven&#8217;t counted how much exactly), then takes a second to flash everything to disk,
then pops a question asking the user to select the best one and possibly delete
the rest. If you don&#8217;t want all of this just tap the back button to return to
shooting mode.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Hub</h2>

<p>Hub is another well designed application which integrates all of your accounts and
messaging into the core of the OS although other mobile OSes have a similar feature
as well if I&#8217;m not mistaken. I just mention it because it is easy and comfortable to use.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Memory Management</h2>

<p>BlackBerry 10 OS memory management is particularly crappy with respect to
the end user. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is due to QNX being real-time OS
or just the Java stack keeping stuff in memory.</p>

<p>After some usage my development Z10 will begin experiencing out of memory issues
(it has 1 GB of RAM vs. 2 GB in production hardware). This will lead to apps
crashing, web pages that were able to open, not being able to load and the most
annoying of all - camera starts taking pictures with random color spots.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bbz10camerafail.jpg" title="BlackBerry Z10 camera fail" alt="Blackberry camera fail" /></p>

<p>After restarting the device everything is back to normal :(.</p>

<h2>BlackBerry Date and Time Synchronization</h2>

<p>This one I also hate a lot. It appears that the software is designed to
automatically synchronize over the Internet and without a reliable connection fails miserably.
After reboot (or even worse battery removal) the device will start with a fixed date and time
somewhere in the past. If it fails to synchronize or takes too long several things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Blackberry Hub application loads first (email and other accounts) which causes all sorts
of warnings of invalid SSL certificates. Which in their own right are annoying because Cancel
means dismiss the warning until the next connection retry; which blocks access to the main menu
for manual configuration;</li>
<li>All images taken by the Camera app will be saved on disk with the wrong date which makes you think
they are gone; I&#8217;ve found this by accident while scrolling way back in my history looking for something
unrelated.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Multiple File Selection</h2>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tested this explicitly on Android or other mobile devices but on BlackBerry
the user needs to tap each individual object to select it. My guess is this is similar
on all devices utilizing a touch screen.  However such interface makes it damn hard to
select a thousand files for deletion (the unusable results from the camera burst mode feature).
Luckily Z10 (and possibly others) has a shell application with <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> and <code>rm -f</code> commands.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve purchased a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0RQSD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B0RQSD0&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=ELZCDTH62GGNKJTL">wireless range extender</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00B0RQSD0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
as the one shown here. It had troubles connecting to the upstream Wi-Fi router
because it used MAC filtering instead of password security. Luckily there was
a <a href="http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=56386.0">forum thread</a> which helped
me figure it out.</p>

<h2>DAP 1320 uses two MAC addresses</h2>

<p>Everything was working just fine with MAC filtering disabled on the upstream
router but failed miserably when enabled. I thought the MAC address provided
on the DAP 1320 packaging was wrong.</p>

<p>It turned out the device had 2 addresses.
The one on the packaging is <em>70:62:B8:07:0B:76</em> and it didn&#8217;t matter if that
is enabled or disabled in the router settings. The second MAC is used when
trying to forward connections through the router. Both addresses differ by the
second symbol with a difference of 2. So I&#8217;ve enabled <em>72:62:B8:07:0B:76</em>
in the router settings and everything worked like a charm.</p>

<h2>Other findings</h2>

<p>Unfortunately if a device is connected to the wifi extender&#8217;s network it will
bypass the MAC filtering employed on the upstream wifi router. As much as I dislike
using passwords for Wi-Fi I had to configure one for the extended network.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also found that when you save the configuration file from the device on your
hard drive it comes in a base64-encoded-line-by-line format. Pretty awkward.</p>

<p>Another pleasant (but not entirely surprising) finding was that D-Link included
a written acknowledgment of using open source components and an offer to provide
source code upon request.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/evolve_digital.jpg" title="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" alt="Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I&#8217;ve visited an event organized by the
<a href="http://www.atlantic-club.org/index.php?en">Atlantic Club of Bulgaria</a> which
officially marked the launch of a digital national alliance in Bulgaria. This is
part of an initiative of the European Commission, called
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs">Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs</a>,
which aims to address the lack of
sufficient amount and quality professionals in Europe working in the
field of Information and Communication technologies.</p>

<p>The first part was few short keynotes, including one from deputy prime minister
and memorandum signing and group photo. In the keynotes (and afterwards)
the stress was on the lack of relevant ICT skills and the need of an estimated
1 million digital workers by 2020 in EU alone.</p>

<p>The next two sessions were panel discussions. The first one presenting the local
chapter of the Digital Coalition in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The goals of the coalition are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>help more people master more digital skills (not only as developers but also
proper usage of social media, how to create content, etc)</li>
<li>enable more people to choose digital jobs</li>
<li>help local talents present themselves on the global scene</li>
</ul>


<p>How it (is supposed to) works:</p>

<ul>
<li>initiate own ideas and propose them for implementation (to the ICT industry and broad public I guess)</li>
<li>stimulate learning through doing, learning by example using real use cases</li>
<li>help (and possibly sponsor) outside projects and ideas</li>
</ul>


<p>Then the various companies supporting the coalition pledged how they are going to
help. The most interesting news from this panel was the announcement of a new HP
data center in Sofia which will be used as a training lab with access available to
students.</p>

<p>The second panel was about education and how to bridge the gap! The interesting points were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ministry of Education and Science admits they have finally realized that our educational
system and programs are behind current tendencies and need concrete steps in order to boost
education and science research;</li>
<li>Samsung will open their innovation lab at Sofia University to outside students as well;</li>
<li>We need to pay more attention to content and training of teachers because they also have
a skills gap while young children do not;</li>
</ul>


<p>I particularly liked what Prof. Petar Kenderov from the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics
at Bulgarian Academy of Sciences said - in the outside world children are constantly sharing
and communicating with each other while at school (also to some extent in universities) they
are expected to not communicate, not share and keep quiet. He emphasized the value of learning through
experimentation vs. learning through reading and writing, e.g. the current way things work
and the old way of teaching.</p>

<p>Another thing that was obvious was that otherwise competing companies (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
VMware) were working together to fix some of the problems mentioned. However I&#8217;m a bit skeptical
that large multi-national companies will be flexible enough to make a positive change.
I&#8217;d bet on the independent organizations like <a href="https://hackbulgaria.com/">HackBulgaria</a> and
Svetlin Nakov&#8217;s <a href="https://softuni.bg/">Software University</a> or initiatives by local Bulgarian companies
like the already proven <a href="http://academy.telerik.com/">Telerik Academy</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the entire program of the event, for anyone interested:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week ended up with <a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a>.
The event was very big this year, with 4 halls and 600 visitors.
I was moderating the so called <em>JavaScript</em> hall and will concentrate on
what happened there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bgws2014.jpg" title="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" alt="BGWS Rhodopi Hall at 10:00" />
This is what my hall looked like at around 10:00 and stayed pretty much the same
during the entire day.</p>

<p>Speakers at hall Rhodopi were (in order of appearance)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/delian">Delian Delchev</a> talking about the JavaScript
revolution taking over the world and how this language has become the most
widely used programming language in the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hkdobrev">Haralan Dobrev</a> with some tips about development
workflows, git, continuous integration and unit testing.</li>
<li>Yoga for Geeks during the lunch break.</li>
<li>Boyan Dzhumakov with topics about home automation and Internet of things, who
demonstrated his bed side lamp controlled via a light sensor and Arduino.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boyanov.org/">Neven Boyanov</a> continuing on the hardware topics with
comparison of ATmel, Arduino and Raspberry Pi and showing more examples of
small programmable devices.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/attodorov">Angel Todorov</a> from Infragistics with a very
interesting talk about JavaScript instrumentation for performance analysis.
A very cool presentation and you should definitely check out his
<a href="https://github.com/attodorov/cheetah.js">cheetah.js</a> framework.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/KrasimirTsonev">Krasimir Tsonev</a> with
<a href="http://absurdjs.com/">AbsurdJS</a> - a JavaScript library with superpowers.
Teaser: Krasimir is also publishing a book caled
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/472723298053537792">Node.js Blueprints</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/krokodilerian">Vasil Kolev</a> with a talk about security
and web service design and how most of the web is doing it wrong :).</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately there is no video or audio recording available. If you find
some of the talks interesting and would like to get more info about it let
me know. I will ask the presenters to share their slides or give more details
where possible.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;ve missed the Web Summit in Sofia. There will be another one
in the autumn, held at Veliko Tarnovo. For more info please subscribe to the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing to report on the last few events that took place in Sofia this week.</p>

<p>Day #2 of DigitalK started with the presentation of Piotr Jas of BlaBla Car.
What I really liked about it (picture TBA) was one particular graph depicting
the various types of travel (time before travel vs. cost of travel) and
visualizing different industries (e.g. air travel) or competitor companies.
The image clearly exhibited a blank space which is the exact market segment
where BlaBla Car have positioned themselves in.</p>

<p>A very practical and easy to use tool for entrepreneurs in my opinion.</p>

<p>From the rest of the keynotes I can outline two in particular:
Ivan Hernandez&#8217; <em>Disruptive Innovation and the future of Digital Transformation</em>
and <em>The future of Tech and Communities</em> by Tim Röhrich.</p>

<p>I liked them because both were very inspirational although not telling you
something which you haven&#8217;t heard before. They were basically reinforcing
the spirit of the event.</p>

<p>In the small hall there was a workshop called
<em>How to turn a good idea into a successful start-up</em> led by Daniela Neumann,
which didn&#8217;t turn out to be what I expected. She was talking about the early
cycle of idea/customer validation and I don&#8217;t remember any particular example
being shown. Frankly most of the people have heard about this before (myself included)
and were quite bored. Not many of them stayed till the end.</p>

<p>The evening continued with the already traditional Silicon Drinkabout in Sofia
which hosted many of the conference attendees. I did a quick visit only
because I had to prepare myself for Bulgaria Web Summit on the next day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The conference season (this week) is officially open! So here&#8217;s my report about it.</p>

<p>It started by accident last evening with a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/629009950539772/">warm-up event</a>
sponsored by Twilio at betahaus Sofia. I had the pleasure to have a long chat
with <a href="https://twitter.com/lilaineurope">Lisa from Twilio</a> over a few beers.</p>

<p>Today was Day #1 of <a href="http://digitalk.bg/">DigitalK</a> which is the leading SEE
technology event. I&#8217;ve also visited the event last year and must say that this
time it is bigger. The main hall was totally packed. The WiFi connectivity has been
improved since last year but still sucked. I had more success using my 3G instead.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of Day #1 was the mini Seedcamp session which presented
10 startups. In order of appearance they are</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.adtapsy.com/">AdTapsy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoini.com/">Bitcoini.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ikollect.net/">iKollect</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rocketads.co/">RocketAds</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scalewhale.eu/">ScaleWhale</a></li>
<li><a href="https://angel.co/smartoken">Smartoken</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stepsss.co/">Stepsss</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.talkie_kids.talkie">Talkie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://viblast.com/">Viblast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiziva.com">Wiziva</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Viblast, Stepsss and Talkie were the 3 finalists who also presented at the main hall.
Needless to say the coolest one from technology point of view is Viblast, which is
a peer-to-peer video streaming platform, utilizing WebRTC. They were also strong at the
presentation and look very strong at the business level as well. I wish them good luck.</p>

<p>Stepsss is essentially a shoe sole with sensors paired with smart-phone apps to
give runners more info and feedback. I like it because they are a hardware company
although there&#8217;s lots of competition in this space. I&#8217;d like to beta test their product
and see what happens when I go dancing all night long :).</p>

<p>Talkie is an educational app for children which helps them learn new languages. I had the
pleasure to see it in action before the actual presentation. The design is very cool
and the app does seem usable and complete. However I don&#8217;t see much of a technological
challenge here and I&#8217;m not sure how will they deal with the strong competition in the ed-tech
space. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>From the rest ScaleWhale and Smartoken do seem interesting but I really failed to get how things
will be organized on the technology side. Both ideas are run by a single person team, which
is a recipe for disaster (judging from my own experience).</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Day #2 of DigitalK and on Saturday I&#8217;m moderating one of the rooms at
<a href="http://bulgariawebsummit.com/">Bulgaria Web Summit</a>. Expect more reports soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QCSA7C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000QCSA7C&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=PY5X54XVJXYLZBIH">The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000QCSA7C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and all I have to say is &#8220;I want to be a robot&#8221;!</p>

<p>This is one of the books that took me the longest time to read. It&#8217;s a hard
to read book because it is full of technical and scientific details, quotes
a great deal of facts and research and leads your mind into fields which
deserve a separate books for themselves.</p>

<p>The purely technical side of the book makes it a bit hard to follow as you need
to have a good deal of understanding of computing technology and concepts and
keep in mind what&#8217;s been said in previous chapters.</p>

<p>Ray Kurzweil starts with historical data about evolution and technological
progress. He postulates his theory of technology evolution called
&#8220;The Law of Accelerating Returns&#8221; and lists a great deal of examples to prove
that evolutionary processes are indeed not linear but exponential.</p>

<p>The next two chapters explain how much is the computational capacity of the
human brain, how to achieve that and how to reverse engineer the brain itself.
Think about 3-D molecular computing, quantum computing, brain imaging and scanning :)</p>

<p>Increased computing capacity and understanding of the human brain
(and general progress of science and technology in the mean time)
will lead to the three revolutions which will make the Singularity possible:
Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics (Strong AI). Ray gives a lot of
examples and current research which is well under way currently or
will become a reality in the next 10 to 30 years.</p>

<p>Following in the book is a list of impacts caused by the advancement of
technology and the Singularity itself. On the human body and brain, on
longevity, on warfare, on work and learning and play, on the Cosmos.</p>

<p>Because the Singularity is not a single event but rather many events which
happen in parallel and gradually over time we will have a hard time defining
what a human means. What is human, what is consciousness and where the line is
are questions which need to be taken into consideration. Ultimately the human
race will become (predominantly) non-biological.</p>

<p>How do you deal with dangers and shortcomings in technology? I myself as a QA
engineer have seen software fail in spectacular ways. How about machine failures?
Now how about nanobots in your blood stream or strong AI gone wild? Ray explains
some of the possible threats and proposals to overcome them. His point is
that benefits from advanced technology will be far greater than dangers and
we will be able to first design our defense systems before anything else that
may threaten our existence.</p>

<p>The last chapter contains examples of criticism and explanations why they
are incorrect which is the first of its kind I&#8217;ve seen in a book.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<blockquote><p>Human Centrality. A common view is that science has consistently been correcting our overly inflated view of our<br/>own significance. Stephen Jay Gould said, &#8220;The most important scientific revolutions all include, as their only<br/>common feature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previous convictions about<br/>our centrality in the cosmos.&#8221;</p><p>But it turns out that we are central, after all. Our ability to create models-virtual realities-in our brains, combined<br/>with our modest-looking thumbs, has been sufficient to usher in another form of evolution: technology. That<br/>development enabled the persistence of the accelerating pace that started with biological evolution. It will continue<br/>until the entire universe is at our fingertips.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello folks, this is my book list for the past 3 months. It ranges from
tech and start-up related to Japanese and kid stories. Here&#8217;s my quick review.</p>

<h2>Lean UX</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449311652/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449311652&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=JNQIKHJJXU3KJ33H">Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449311652" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
is the second book I read on the subject after first reading
<a href="/blog/2013/12/09/book-review-ux-for-lean-startups/">UX for Lean Startups</a>.</p>

<p>It is published before <em>UX for Lean Startups</em> and is much more about principles than
any practical methods. Honestly I&#8217;m not sure if I took any real value out of it.
Maybe if I had read these two books in reverse order it would have been better.</p>

<h2>The Hacienda - How Not to Run a Club</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DEKLESK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DEKLESK&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=FOMGYFQW4BHGPPOL">The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DEKLESK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Peter Hook is one of my favorites. It covers a great deal of music and clubland history,
depicts crazy parties and describes the adventure of owning one of the most
popular nightclubs in the world. All of that while struggling to make a buck and
pouring countless pounds into a black hole.</p>

<p>The irony is The Hacienda became a legendary place only after it had closed down
and later on being demolished.</p>

<p>A must read for anyone who is considering business in the entertainment industry
or wants to read a piece of history. My favorite quote of the book:</p>

<blockquote><p>Years after, Tony Wilson found himself sitting opposite Madonna at dinner.</p><p>‘I eventually plucked up the courage to look across the table to Madonna and ask,<br/>“Are you aware that the first place you appeared outside of New York was our club in Manchester?”</p><p>‘She gave me an ice-cold stare and said, “My memory seems to have wiped that.”’</p></blockquote>


<h2>Simple Science Experiments</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0713428945/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0713428945&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=HU6TVCNR6DG67EFG">Simple Science Experiments</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0713428945" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Hans Jürgen Press is a very old book listing 200 experiments which you can
do at home using household materials. It is great for teaching basic science
to children. The book is very popular and is available in many languages
and editions - just search for it.</p>

<p>I used to have this as a kid and was able to purchase the 1987 Bulgarian edition
at an antique bookstore in Varna two months ago.</p>

<h2>Ronia, the Robber&#8217;s Daughter</h2>

<p>Decided to experiment a little bit and found
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140317201/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140317201&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=FDHOPXQCZPMYCAA2">Ronia, the Robber&#8217;s Daughter</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0140317201" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
It&#8217;s a child&#8217;s book telling the story of two kids whose fathers are rival
robbers. The book is an easy read (2-3 hrs before bed time) with stories
of magic woods, dwarfs and scary creatures mixed with human emotions
and the good vs. bad theme.</p>

<h2>Japanese Short Stories</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve managed to find a 1973 compilation of Japanese short stories
translated into Bulgarian. Also one of my favorite books.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m not mistaken these are classic
Japanese authors, nothing modern or cutting edge. Most of the action happens
during the early 1900s as far as I can tell.
What impresses me most is the detailed description of nature and
surrounding details in all of the stories.</p>

<h2>The Singularity Is Near</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve also started
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143037889&linkCode=as2&tag=atodorovorg-20&linkId=BKMQ47NQEXNTDDRR">The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=atodorovorg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0143037889" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
by Ray Kurzweil.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit hard to read because the book is full of so many technical details
about genetics, nanotechnology, robotics and AI.</p>

<p>Ray depicts a bright future where humans will transcend our biological
limitations and essentially become pure intelligence. Definitely a good
read and I will tell you more about it when I finish it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you remember I was going to
<a href="/blog/2013/08/01/laptop-vs-smartphone-part-one/">replace my laptop for a smartphone</a>.
There&#8217;s the issue with a desk working environment and one solution is to buy an external
display. The other one is to use a

as shown on the picture
(source <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2PC-Enlarger-Magnifier-for-Mobile-Screen-3-Times-for-All-Mobiles-Senior-2014-New-/181398272903?pt=UK_Holders_Mounts&amp;hash=item2a3c2dfb87">eBay</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/mobile_screen_magnifier.jpg" title="Mobile Screen Magnifier" alt="Mobile Screen Magnifier" /></p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with these? Ultimately it should be possible to use
any 3x Fresnel lens magnifier and make your 5&#8221; phone display into a 15&#8221; laptop size one.
The magnifiers used for reading,

are cheap and portable but don&#8217;t look very well around the edges.</p>

<p>If anyone has such a device at hand I&#8217;d love to see if this works for you or not.
Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week at <a href="http://hackfmi.com">HackFMI 3.0</a> one team had to display a form
which presented multiple choice selection for filtering, where the filter keys
are read from the database. They&#8217;ve solved the problem by simply building up the
HTML required inside the view. I was wondering if this can be done with forms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hackfmi/hackfmi_beer.jpg" alt="HackFMI" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p>The fourth <a href="http://hackfmi.com/hackfmi3-winners/">HackFMI</a>,
now traditional, hackathon was held this weekend.
It is over and I still can&#8217;t wrap my head around what happened during these 3 nights. Here&#8217;s
bits of code, beer, energy drinks and fun as I saw it.</p>

<p>A big thanks goes to Lilly and Misha who were running around like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL6e3co4Qqc">robots</a> managing the day-to-day activities.
Kudos to the rest of the team as well because they&#8217;ve established HackFMI as a tradition
and people already ask when is going to be the next event.</p>

<h2>What</h2>

<p>This year the topic was <em>Hack for charity</em> and immediate goal of raising money for
a sick kid. Most of the teams got to work to meet these goals. Only a few had worked
on slightly different charity (broadly defined) ideas.</p>

<p>My favorite two apps were Blago-darenie and SMShelp although they were not
developed with Django.</p>

<p><a href="http://blago-darenie.outernetnotes.com/">Blago-darenie</a> is a simple WordPress
site listing donation campaigns. Instead of directly donating money one needs to
promise something (an action, an object, etc) and put a price tag on it. When the
promise is claimed the two parties donate the money to that particular campaign
and exchange the promised goods or services. I&#8217;ve promised to cook dinner
involving tasty meatballs from horse meat and serve one of my wine bottles to whoever
decides to donate 25 EUR. (disclaimer: I&#8217;m a good cook and love wine more than code).</p>

<p><a href="http://ganev.bg/project-8/">SMShelp</a> is an aggregator of donation campaigns via SMS
which are very popular in the country but lack a central repository for all of them.
A simple web site, live Android app and wonderful design secured the team the first place!
BTW Team 8 was <a href="http://atodorov.org/blog/2013/04/15/hackfmi-post-mortem/">Adrian and Vihren</a>
who took part in all previous editions as well.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m glad both organizers and teams had listened to some of my feedback but there are
still things to improve. The most obvious one was that a quick communication channel
to all the teams is needed. Facebook and email just didn&#8217;t cut it.</p>

<p>I already have couple of quick ideas involving Django and Twilio&#8217;s cloud services.
Let me take a few more days to get it clear before going any further.</p>

<h2>/me</h2>

<p>I found myself mentoring as much as I could helping folks with Django or just
with general ideal or concepts, serving cake provided by <a href="http://www.chaosgroup.com">Chaos Group</a>
and opening stacks of energy drinks, going door to door and letting teams know deployment and presentation
details for the last day.</p>

<p>What surprised me a bit was that there were many new teams (some involving previous contestants)
who were very diverse in their technological background. This presented a challenge to
some of them as they had to use a technology which nobody on the team knew very well
and had to make a working app with that. One team even changed from Python to PHP in the
middle of day 2.</p>

<p>On Sunday I was pretty much helping the HackFMI team with whatever I can,
checking on my favorite teams from time to time and giving access to cloud servers
left and right to people who needed them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I missed the Grand Finale due to unexpected hardware problems involving
big iron and 150 litters of loose water :(. See you next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve heard about companies opening up their proprietary software products,
this is hardly news nowadays. But have you wondered what it is like to migrate
production software from closed to open source? I would like to share my own
experience about going open source as seen from behind the keyboard.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> was recently open sourced and the steps to go through
were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplify - remove everything that can be deleted</li>
<li>Create self contained modules aka re-organize the file structure</li>
<li>Separate internal from external modules</li>
<li>Refactor the existing code</li>
<li>Select license and update copyright</li>
<li>Update 3rd party dependencies to latest versions and add requirements.txt</li>
<li>Add README and verbose settings example</li>
<li>Split difio/ into its own git repository</li>
<li>Test stand alone deployments on fresh environment</li>
<li>Announce</li>
</ul>


<p>Do you want to know more? Use the comments and tell me what exactly!
I&#8217;m writing a longer version of this article so stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Beware if you are using code like this:</p>

<pre><code>models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now())
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. passing a function return value as the default option for a model field in Django.
In some cases the value will be calculated once when the application starts or
the module is imported and will not be updated later. The most common scenario
is DateTime fields which default to now(). The correct way is to use a callable:</p>

<pre><code>models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now)
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ve hit this issue on a low volume application which uses cron to collect its own
metrics by calling an internal URL. The app was running as WSGI app and I wondered
why I got records with duplicate dates in the DB. A more detailed (correct) example follows:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> also had the same bug but didn&#8217;t exhibit the problem
because all objects with default date-time values were created on the backend nodes
which get updated and restarted very often.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y">talk by Simon Sinek</a>
about leadership. He talks about Endorphins, Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin
and how they make us feel and act a particular way. Then I though - maybe that&#8217;s why working
in the open source field always felt great and natural to me. Maybe we humans
are programmed to follow the open source way!</p>

<p>This article scratches the surface where body chemistry and open source intersect.
I hope it will help both volunteers and community managers get an insight of the
driving forces in our bodies, how they relate to the open source world and promt
further exploration. By seeking to better understand the positive effects and avoid
the negative ones we can become better contributors and leaders which ultimately
helps our communities.</p>

<h2>Endorphins</h2>

<p>Endorphins stand for endurance. Their job is to mask physical pain and it has been
suggested to have evolutionary roots based on the theory that they helped with the
survival of early humans. Athletes experience so called Runner&#8217;s high.</p>

<p>In the open source world one may work on a feature or task for hours and hours
without feeling exhausted. The task itself keeps you going and excited.
This is endorphins going through your brain.</p>

<p>In software one may experience an endorphin rush during public release days for example. For large
projects like Fedora the release process includes many steps and may take several hours.
During all that time the release engineer is usually available regardless of their native
time zone.</p>

<p>Effects of endorphins could potentially increase the likelihood of injury or extreme exhaustion,
as pain sensation could be more easily ignored. Work and rest cycles need to be properly balanced.</p>

<h2>Dopamine</h2>

<p>This is the feeling when we achieve our goals or found something we were looking for.
Dopamine helps us get things done! This is why we&#8217;re told to write down our goals and then
cross them off. It makes people more productive.</p>

<p>Getting dopamine through open source is very easy - all you need to do is fix a bug,
then another one, and another one, and another one &#8230; After every task you complete the body
gets a small dopamine fix. &#8220;Release early, release often &#8230;&#8221; and you get your fix :).</p>

<p>Dopamine however is highly addictive and destructive if unbalanced. It has the same negative
effects as any other addiction - alcohol, drugs, etc. Be aware of that and don&#8217;t fall for the
performance trap.</p>

<p>Endorphins and Dopamine are so called selfish chemicals. You can get them without external help.
The next two are the social chemicals.</p>

<h2>Serotonin</h2>

<p>It is responsible for feelings of pride and status and assessing social rank.
Serotonin is produced when you are recognized for achievements by the open source community
or credited by somebody (e.g. Johnny Bravo mentioned a great idea on IRC today).</p>

<p>As a contributor one may work on items which will help you get recognition but ultimately this
is not for you to decide. However practice shows that credit and recognition are relatively easy
to get in the open source world provided one has contributed to make the project and the
community better in some sort.</p>

<p>In software this is being granted commit rights to a repository, being in the top spot of
some metrics, having your blog read by other members or simply people asking for help or
what you think about some topic.</p>

<p>Serotonin is considered the leadership chemical. As one becomes a leader recognized by the
community there&#8217;s a catch - the more your status goes up the more work you have to
do. The more people recognize you as the leader the more they expect you to sacrifice yourself
in case it all goes Pete Tong. If you are not ready to step up find a more suitable place in
the community instead.</p>

<h2>Oxytocin</h2>

<p>Oxytocin is responsible for feelings of love, trust and friendship. It makes us feel safe.
It is also very good for the body because it makes us healthier, boosts our
immune system, increases ability to solve problems and increases creativity.</p>

<p>One way to get Oxytocin is by physical touch - e.g. a hand shake. This is probably one of
the reasons beer gatherings are so popular among open source developers.
Working digitally we need a way to
reinforce human bonds in our communities. Knowing the person on the other end of the wire
ultimately makes us feel safer. If you are in open source just go for that conference or a
local beer bash you wanted to go - it is good for you (but don&#8217;t get drunk).</p>

<p>Another way to get Oxytocin is by performing or witnessing acts of human generosity.
This comes natural in open source world where people give up their free time and energy to work towards
a shared goal. Just by working in an open source environment you get all that goodness for you.</p>

<p>The best thing about Oxytocin is that it is not addictive and slowly builds up in the body.
The bad side is that it takes a while to build up. This is why you have to stay a little longer
in open source before it starts feeling safe and welcoming.</p>

<h2>Cortisol</h2>

<p>The last chemical Simon talks about is Cortisol. It is bad, very bad. It will crash your body.
Cortisol means stress. It is designed to keep humans (and animals) alive by hyper tuning
our senses in case of danger. Trouble is you are not supposed to have it in your body for
long periods of time because it shuts down non-essential systems to deliver that extra energy.</p>

<p>Luckily most open source projects are not stressful and I think can be considered a safe place
to work in. In the end one can always shift to another role or move to another project if it
becomes too pressing.</p>

<p>By committing
to help another member or perform service to the community our bodies get all the good
stuff and beat the negative. Service to a community is exactly what open source does!
See, humans are programmed to live and work the open source way!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The biggest problem of Facebook is the sheer number of news items
which are filtered out if users are not actively engaged with them.
For a page admin/business owner this means Facebook makes a poor job at reaching
to my fans and potential customers unless I keep paying them money!
I need two basic features to solve this problem.</p>

<h2>Contact All Users App aka Newsletter</h2>

<p>I need to be able to message my fan base like a newsletter with the following
requirements in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users have already liked the page, don&#8217;t make them sign-up or follow anything else;</li>
<li>Preferably use Facebook messages instead of email;</li>
<li>Let them unsubscribe from the newsletter without going away/blocking the page;</li>
</ul>


<p>The first one is straight forward - I&#8217;ve already put some money in promoting my page
and collecting fans. No need for more hurdles to get started. For reference out of 500
users none has actually subscribed to the page. This gives you an idea how much they
will subscribe to newsletters and such. They click LIKE and forget about it.</p>

<p>The second one is dependent on the target audience. I have the feeling that my target
audience is reading Facebook messages much more than email.</p>

<p>My primary use case of this will be to send new offers and validation queries to the
target audience in order to tailor the content and business to them.</p>

<h2>Weekly Digest App</h2>

<p>Looking at my Facebook page stats it is clear that only promoted content gets a higher reach.
This includes both content paid for and content posted during periods where the page itself
had an active advertisement.</p>

<p>This is no coincidence I think. When the page is promoted to new audience they will get around
the available tabs, explore and like pictures and scroll down to see some of the older content.
Assuming the person becomes a page fan they will fall into the previously described trap (content filter)
and not see much of the page activity.</p>

<p>I need an application which will aggregate the content from the last week and send it to
everyone. This app needs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be able to configure digest period/cut-off days and when to send the digest;</li>
<li>Allow users to unsubscribe or alter their digest preferences;</li>
</ul>


<p>Primary use case is to alert users of content which they may have missed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bonus feature: exclude content which was seen by the specific person or they somehow reacted to it;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Where to next </h2>

<p>I am actively looking for such kinds of apps but haven&#8217;t found any yet. When time allows I will
be looking at the Facebook API to see if this is at all possible to implement.</p>

<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a quick example of SMS PIN verification using Twilio cloud services and
Django which I did for a small site recently.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sms_pin.png" title="SMS PIN form" alt="SMS PIN form" /></p>

<p>The page template contains the following HTML snippet</p>

<p>PINs are only numeric and are stored in the CACHE instead of the database which
I think is simpler and less expensive in terms of I/O operations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/effective-february-2014/">Last month</a> Amazon
reduced by 50% prices for EBS storage. This, combined with
<a href="/blog/2014/02/07/aws-tip-shrinking-ebs-root-volume-size/">shrinking EBS root volume size</a> and
<a href="/blog/2014/02/10/moving-tmp-from-ebs-to-instance-storage/">moving /tmp to instance storage</a>
allowed me to reduce EBS related costs behind <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> by around 50%.
Following are the real figures from my AWS Bill.</p>

<p>EBS costs for Difio were gradually rising up with every new node added to the cluster and
increased package processing (resulting in more I/O):</p>

<ul>
<li>November 2013 - $7.38</li>
<li>December 2013 - $10.55</li>
<li>January 2014 - $11.97</li>
</ul>

<p>In February there was one new system added to process additional requests
(cluster nodes run as spot instances) and an increased number of temporary
instances (although I haven&#8217;t counted them) while I was restructuring AMI
internals to accommodate the <a href="https://github.com/difio/difio">open source</a>
version of Difio. My assumption (based on historical data) is this would
have driven the costs up in the region of $15 per month only for EBS.</p>

<p>After implementing the stated minimal improvements and having Amazon reduced the prices by
half the bill looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>February 2014 </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>EBS

</span><span class='line'>$0.05  per 1 million I/O requests               5,704,482 IOs   $0.29
</span><span class='line'>                                                        Total:  $4.01</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><em>Snapshot data stored</em> is the volume of snapshots (AMIs, backups, etc) which
I have. This is fairly constant.</p>

<p><em>Provisioned storage</em> is the volume of EBS storage provisioned for running
instances (e.g. root file system, data partitions, etc.). This was reduced
mainly because of shrinking the root volumes. (Previously I&#8217;ve used larger
root volumes for a bigger /tmp).</p>

<p><em>I/O requests</em> is the number of I/O requests associated with your EBS volumes.
As far as I understand Amazon doesn&#8217;t charge for I/O related to ephemeral storage.
Moving /tmp from EBS to instance storage is the reason this was reduced roughly by half.</p>

<h2>Where To Next</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve reduced the root volumes back to the 8GB defaults but this has still room for
improvement b/c the AMI is quite minimal. This will bring the largest improvements.
Another thing is the still relatively high I/O rate that touches EBS volumes.
I haven&#8217;t investigated where this comes from though.</p>
