  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="/blog/2013/09/14/upcoming-talk-fedora-test-days-in-sofia/">mentioned earlier</a>
I will organize some Fedora testing in Sofia. Here&#8217;s an outline of my talk this
Saturday and a general guide for anyone who wants to participate.</p>

<h2>What are Fedora Test Days</h2>

<p>Fedora Test Days are day long events focused on testing a particular feature
in the upcoming Fedora release. At the time of writing they are focused on
Fedora 20.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To all my readers - sorry for not being able to blog more frequently lately.
Here&#8217;s an easy read about my favourite laptop brand Lenovo and some of their
design flaws I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<h2>X220 and T60 Batterries are ALMOST Identical</h2>

<p><img src="/images/lenovo_x220_t60_battery.jpg" title="X220 and T60 batteries" alt="&quot;X220 and T60 batteries&quot;" /></p>

<p>As you can see the <a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">X220</a> and
<a href="http://amzn.to/183SgiR">T60</a> batteries are nearly identical with the notable
exception of the connector placement. The end result - I have to purchase yet another
battery as a backup for long travel/work on the go. Not what I want.</p>

<p>I wish all Lenovo models had the same batteries so people can swap them around
as they wish. Is this too much to ask for? Have you seen another brand which
got this right?</p>

<h2>ThinkPad Mini Dock Design Flaw</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m using a <a href="http://amzn.to/15tjUYi">ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3</a> docking station
with my X220 laptop. Being a QA engineer for so long I immediately
noticed something that wasn&#8217;t quite right. The buttons on the left and the mechanism
next to them are blocking the hot air exhaust from the CPU fan. This model of docking
station is made to fit several models of laptops and those which dock in position 2 are
less affected from those which dock in possition 1. Mine was not a lucky one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/alone.jpg" title="docking station in position 2" alt="docking station in position 2" /></p>

<p>On the pictures below it is clearly visible that most of the hot air coming out of the CPU
fan is blocked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/top.jpg" title="top view" alt="top view" />
<img src="/images/dock/back.jpg" title="back view" alt="back view" />
<img src="/images/dock/side.jpg" title="side view" alt="side view" /></p>

<p>In order to reduce laptop heating and provide better cooling I decided to remove the
1/2 position switch mechanism. To do that you have to unscrew all screws from the docking
station and carefully split the top and bottom halves. The offending piece of plastic is
screwed with two tiny screws at the bottom. Once they are removed everything comes off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dock/removed.jpg" title="blocking part removed" alt="blocking part removed" /></p>

<p>Even with this piece removed my laptop still hets up too much! I guess 80 C is just
normal for the Core i7 processors :(.</p>

<p>Have you found something not quite right in your hardware design? Please share in the
comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On September 28th I will be giving a short talk about
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Test_Days">Fedora Test Days</a> at the regular
Linux for Bulgarians
<a href="http://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&amp;key=459487176">conference</a>.
I will explain what these are and how one can participate. I will also announce
my plans and schedule to organize some
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Fedora_20_test_days">Fedora 20 test days</a>
locally in Sofia. If you are a fan of Fedora and want to file bugs and kick
some developers&#8217; ass this is the way to do it!</p>

<p>Other talks include Alexander Shopov&#8217;s „Oracle&#8217;s take on NoSQL“ which I wanted
to hear since this summer and TBA talks about MicroTik routers.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on September 28th at the French Institute at
Sofia University
(see <a href="http://conf.linux-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/su-2.png">map</a>).
It starts at 13:00 and my talk should be at the beginning. See you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/08/23/red-hats-ebugzilla-hits-one-million-bugs/">previous post</a>
I asked the readers of this blog to pick a bug number from Red Hat&#8217;s Bugzilla
so I can analyze it later.</p>

<p><a href="http://radorado.me">Radoslav Georgiev</a> decided to step up and
selected the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">Leet</a> bug
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337</a></p>

<p>This is a rather old bug against kernel, in particular
against the token ring driver. There isn&#8217;t much info on the bug but it seems
the issue is hardware dependent and doesn&#8217;t reproduce reliably.</p>

<p>Looking at the bug status and history it looks like it was closed without
fixing it. Most likely the reason for this was there was no hardware
to test, bug was not reproduced and no customers were seeing the issue or
were willing to test and work with devel!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to see my comments on other interesting bugs just post a link
to them in the comments section.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/redhat_1mil_bugs.jpg" title="RHBZ 1 million" alt="&quot;RHBZ 1 million&quot;" /></p>

<p>Red Hat&#8217;s Bugzilla passed the 1 million bugs milestone yesterday!
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000">RHBZ #1000000</a> has been
filed by Anton Arapov, a kernel engineer and a very nice guy (I know him btw).
I&#8217;ve filed several bugs yesterday but the last one was #999941. A bit too short!</p>

<p>To celebrate this event I dare you to pick some bugs from Bugzilla that you find
interesting or frustrating and I will try to analyze and explain them from a
QA engineer&#8217;s point of view. Since I&#8217;ve reported over 1000 bugs and been involved in
another close to 5000 I think I will be able to answer almost any question.</p>

<p>Challenge accepted!</p>

Where on Earth is the &#8220;code below&#8221; ? I&#8217;ve already
<a href="https://twitter.com/atodorov_/status/370833992074809345">reported it</a>. Let&#8217;s

<p>One thing you need to know when ordering Red Hat subscriptions is your
account number. It is available in the drop down menu at the top right
corner after you login at <a href="https://access.redhat.com">https://access.redhat.com</a>.</p>

<p>New accounts don&#8217;t have an account number. It will be generated after
the first subscription activation.</p>

<p>If you need to know more about Red Hat&#8217;s ordering process just ask me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in February 2013 Russell Beattie has published an article on his blog
titled
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services">Artisanal Websites: The rise of .io domains for well crafted web services</a>
. He has compiled a great deal of sites in the .io domain space with screenshots
and links to each individual service. There are lots of interesting ones, so
go and check them out!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad Russell has added <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> as well!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> is coming to an end
I&#8217;m publishing an interesting update from
<a href="cz.linkedin.com/in/mullerpetr">Petr Muller</a> for
those who were not able to attend.
Petr is a Senior Quality Engineer at Red Hat. His notes were
sent to an internal QE mailing list and re-published with permission.</p>

<blockquote><p>As this year&#8217;s GUADEC happened in the same building where I have my<br/>other office, I decided to attend. I&#8217;m sharing my notes from the two<br/>sessions I consider to be especially interesting for the audience of<br/>this mailing list:</p><p>== How to not report your UX bug ==<br/>Speaker:    Fabiana Simões<br/>Blog:       http://fabianapsimoes.wordpress.com/<br/>Twitter:    https://twitter.com/fabianapsimoes</p><p>Do not do this stuff:<br/>* Do not simply present a preferred solution, but describe a problem (a<br/>difficulty you are having, etc.)<br/>* Do not use &#8220;This sucks&#8221; idiom, not even hidden in false niceties like<br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s not user friendly&#8221;<br/>* Do not talk for majority, when you are not entitled to (&#8220;most users<br/>would like&#8221;)<br/>* Do not consider all UX issues as minor: an inability to do stuff is<br/>not a minor issue</p><p>What is actually interesting for the designer in a report?<br/>* What were you trying to do?<br/>* Why did you want to do it?<br/>* What did you do?<br/>* What happened?<br/>* What were your expectations?</p><p>More notes<br/>* Write as much as needed<br/>* Describe what you see, did and *how you felt*<br/>* Print screen is your friend!<br/>* *Give praise*</p><p>== Extreme containment measures: keeping bug reports under control ==<br/>Speaker:  Jean-Francois Fortin Tam<br/>Homepage: http://jeff.ecchi.ca<br/>Twitter:  https://twitter.com/nekohayo</p><p>Discussed the problem lot of OS projects are having: lot of useless<br/>(old, irrelevant, waiting for decision no one wants to make) bug/rfe<br/>reports in their bug tracking systems. Lots of food for thought about<br/>our own projects, internal or external. Clever applications of<br/>principles from personal productivity systems such as GTD and Inbox Zero<br/>for bug tracking.  </p><p>The talk was mostly an applied version of this blog post, which is worth<br/>reading:<br/>http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/10/08/reducing-our-core-apps-software-inventory/</p><footer><strong>Petr Muller</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>I particularly like the UX bug reporting guide lines. Need to take those into
account when reporting UI issues.</p>

<p>I still haven&#8217;t read the second blog post which also looks interesting although
not very applicable to me. After all I&#8217;m the person reporting bugs not the one
who decides what and when gets fixed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two hours ago I&#8217;ve heard on the radio about
<a href="http://acl2013.org/site/">the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics</a>
which is held at the moment in Sofia
According to the guest speaker (a professor from Bulgarian Academy of Science) the official
program will be over today but the next two days will feature workshops and tutorials.</p>

<p>Definitely not to be missed if you are in Sofia. I&#8217;m not unfortunately :(.
If you can please visit and share what you saw with me. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BlackBerry 10 OS application security model is enforced by two major components:
<a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/topic/c_appfund_accessing_restricted_functionality.html">app permissions</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/topic/accessible_folders.html">filesystem access privileges</a>.</p>

<p>Also it looks like that each app is assigned a separate group id. Below is a listing
of my currently installed apps as seen from <code>devuser</code>. An application can&#8217;t execute
another apps (e.g. exec) as far as I can see. Not possible with the shell app either.</p>

<p>I think I will have to
bundle all command line tools together with a shell into a single app so the shell
is able to invoke any of the commands that are not system standard. I&#8217;m not liking this
very much!</p>

<p>$HOME is inside the app space too :(. See my other post about
<a href="/blog/2013/08/05/exploring-blackberry-10-environment-variables/">environment variables</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/hackfmi/Logo_SummerHackFMI.png" alt="Summer HackFMI" style="display:block;clear:both" /></p>

<p>A <a href="http://hackfmi.com/spontanen-leten-hachathon/">summer hackathon</a>
will be held in Sofia between 16th and 22nd of August. The week prior to the
event (12th to 15th) will be full of lectures and workshops to prepare the students
for their task.</p>

<p>The goal this time is to create a new system for the Student Council organization
which will host their new website and also provide more transparency into the
organization and the work they do. The idea is initiated by the chairman of the
council which is quite surprising for me to hear. You can read his motivation
(in Bulgarian) <a href="https://github.com/Hackfmi/SummerHackathon/blob/master/motivation.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment it is agreed that the system will be written in Python and Django
and this is where I join. Together with Kiril Vladimirov I will be leading the
Python/Django lecture and workshop in one of the days, likely 14th of August.</p>

<p>The program is not yet finalized so I can&#8217;t share more info. Please watch this
space for more details when they are available.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some of you may know or have heard I&#8217;m in the process of  ditching my
<a href="http://amzn.to/12y5hwp">Lenovo X220</a> in favor of a smartphone. The ultimate
goal is to not need a personal computer at all and use only one device for
all my processing needs. Everything else can be conveniently migrated to
the cloud. The current favorite device is <a href="http://amzn.to/12y4ewJ">BlackBerry Z10</a>
but that may change as I explore the smartphone world and my requirements.</p>

<p>This is my list of requirements, mainly for my own reference but you are welcome
to comment and give me suggestions how to migrate.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I need a test for the battery life of a smartphone in use and while traveling
and connected to the Internet. Data shown is as given by manufacturer. Talking
from experience the 10 hrs talk time are roughly equivalent to 10 hrs of Internet
and apps usage. I have to charge my Z10 almost every day and I still don&#8217;t use it
that actively.</p></li>
<li><p>The displays of all recent smartphones are far better than notebooks. I can read
my phone outside but haven&#8217;t actually tried a direct sunlight exposure. Will do this
and update with more info.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed storage may be an issue, although I don&#8217;t use storage intensive applications.
Will test this and report with more info.</p></li>
<li><p>RAM is a <strong>BIG</strong> issue. Currently my desktop utilizes around 4GB but on x86_64
objects are bigger (Python objects are 4x compared to i386). I&#8217;ve previously used
an old Lenovo T60 with only 2GB of RAM and i386 environment. Didn&#8217;t have any issues.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>On Z10 the memory is not utilized in the best fashion. Something is eating away
RAM and I&#8217;m left with around 150MB of free memory after some phone use. For one
<code>/tmp</code> is mounted directly into RAM and some apps are misbehaving. I&#8217;ve seen a low
cost Android tablets and phones running with 512MB of RAM. Need to investigate more.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Virtualization and most importantly USB pass-through is a critical issue. I have
a proprietary smart-card electronic signature device which needs to continue working.
I have no problems running a cloud instance but haven&#8217;t figured out how to do USB
pass-through between local hardware and cloud instance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UPDATE 2013-08-03</strong>: USB host mode is essential for some docking hardware. This means that the phone
will be able to connect to external USB devices such as USB drives or cameras.

</code></pre>

<p>I will describe my software use cases in details in a later update. Most important of all is
a nice text editor to write code and text (mainly this blog) and the shell tools.</p>

<h2>Roll-out Plan</h2>

<p>To make things easier I will first transition entertainment and personal
activities and later work related ones.</p>

<p>In the next few days I will start
by exploring all the hardware requirements first and update this blog with
some of the findings. Along with this I will share the personal activities
progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I&#8217;ve
<a href="/blog/2013/07/31/how-i-created-a-website-in-two-days-without-coding/">mentioned</a>
a start-up project called
<a href="http://obuvki41plus.com">obuvki41plus.com</a> and that it accepts phone orders
instead of online electronic orders like everyone else. I will tell you why.</p>

<p><img src="/images/phone_order.jpg" alt="Taking phone orders" style="clear:both;display:block;" />
<em>Image CC-BY <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/southernfoodwaysalliance/3291060837/">Southern Foodways Alliance</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://obuvki41plus.com/">obuvki41plus.com</a> is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus, which are hard to find in Bulgaria.
There is a shopping cart component on the website which at the end redirects to
a simple page with instructions how to order via phone. Why not online
orders like everyone else? Several reasons!</p>

<p>The business target group is very limited - women who wear large shoe size
and like the proposed shoe style and can afford the higher price (quality shoes
only, sorry). On top of
that the business model is <strong>online only</strong>. The rule of thumb is to <strong>make
everything possible to lower barrier to entry for customers</strong>!
Also don&#8217;t make our lives harder in doing so.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phone ordering is the easiest way for customers in Bulgaria.
I myself often prefer it because of the too many steps and too many fields
to fill-in when ordering online. The reality is that most local websites
are horribly made with respect to user experience and many users are not
that fluent with Internet as it may seem. No need to get people frustrated
if they are about to spend their money with you!</p></li>
<li><p>Phone ordering, especially in the early business stage lets you know
your customers. This is invaluable feedback for you as the owner and you
can&#8217;t get that from an online ordering system. It just doesn&#8217;t work,
I&#8217;ve tried!</p></li>
<li><p>A phone ordering system is just so easy to implement. Later that can
be scaled with some automated IVR system and a call center; Or just
migrate it to online ordering system;</p></li>
<li><p>The website in question is supposed to be no-maintenance as much
as possible. It is static HTML and no database at all. Introducing
online ordering is just too much of a technological overhead in this case;</p></li>
<li><p>Last but probably most important is customer care - not only we want to
make it easy for them to order but want to prevent frequent returns
caused by wrong product expectations or incorrect size. After all shoes
need to be tried first.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So to summarize - the orders are taken in person via phone
including objection handling and questions answering. An order may consist
of up to 3 pairs of shoes which are shipped to the customer with the option
to try them out upon delivery! Buy all or just a pair - it&#8217;s a customer call!
Small return fee is imposed to prevent abuse!</p>

<p>For that kind of business this seems to be the best solution so far.
I&#8217;d love to hear other owners experience and decision logic. Please use
the comments to tell us how you&#8217;ve organized the sales/ordering/delivery
process in your company and why so. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/logos/obuvki41plus_header.png" title="header image" alt="header image" /></p>

<p>This is a simple story about a website I helped create without using any
programming at all. It took me two days because of the images and the logo
design which I&#8217;ve commissioned to a friend.</p>

<p>The website is <a href="http://obuvki41plus.com/">obuvki41plus.com</a> which is a
re-seller business my spouse runs. It specializes in large size, elegant
ladies shoes - Europe size 41 plus (hard to find in Bulgaria),
hence the name.</p>

<h2>Required Functionality</h2>

<ul>
<li>Display a catalog of items for sale with detailed information about
each item;</li>
<li>Make it possible for people to comment and share the items;</li>
<li>Very basic shopping cart which stores the selected items and then
redirects to a page with order instructions. Actual order is made via
phone for several reasons which I will explain in
<a href="/blog/2013/08/01/why-taking-orders-by-phone-works-for-my-start-up/">another post</a>;</li>
<li>Add a feedback/contact form;</li>
<li>Look nice on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technology</h2>

<ul>
<li>The website is static, all pages are simple HTML and is hosted in
Amazon S3;</li>
<li>Comments are provided by Facebook&#8217;s
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Comments Box</a>
plug-in;</li>
<li>Social media buttons and tracking are provided by
<a href="https://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a>;</li>
<li>Visitors analytics is standard and is from
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>;</li>
<li>Template is from <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with slight
modifications; Works on mobile too;</li>
<li>Logo is custom designed by my friend
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aluinpoli">Polina Valerieva</a>;</li>
<li>Feedback/contact form is by <a href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>;</li>
<li>Shopping cart is by <a href="http://simplecartjs.org/">simpleCart(js)</a>.
I&#8217;ve created a simple animation effect when pressing the &#8220;ADD TO CART&#8221;
link to visually alert the user. This is done with jQuery.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could have used some JavaScript templating engine like
<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> but at the time I didn&#8217;t know about
it and I prefer not to write JavaScript if possible :).</p>

<h2>Colophon</h2>

<p>I did some coding after the initial release eventually.
I&#8217;ve transformed the website to a Django
based site which is exported as static HTML.</p>

<p>This helps me with faster deployment/management as everything is stored
in git, allows templates inheritance and also makes the site ready to
add more functionality if required.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/startup/imagga.png" alt="Imagga" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://imagga.com/">Imagga</a> is a cloud platform that helps businesses and
individuals organize their images in a fast and cost-effective way. They
develop a range of advanced proprietary image recognition and image processing
technologies, which are built into several services such as smart image
cropping, color extraction and multi-color search, visual similarity search and
auto-tagging.</p>

<p>During
<a href="/blog/2013/05/23/balkan-venture-forum-sofia-post-mortem/">Balkan Venture Forum</a>
in Sofia I sat down with Georgi Kadrev to talk about technology.
Surprisingly this hi-tech service is built on top of standard low-tech components
and lots of hard work.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>Core functionality is developed in C and C++ with the OpenCV library.
Imagga relies heavily on own image processing algorithms for their core
features. These were built as a combination of their own research activities
and publications from other researchers.</p>

<p>Image processing is executed by worker nodes configured with their own
software stack. Nodes are distributed among Amazon EC2 and other data centers.</p>

<p>Client libraries to access Imagga API are available in PHP, Ruby and Java.</p>

<p>Imagga has built several websites to showcase their technology.
<a href="http://cropp.me/">Cropp.me</a>, <a href="http://colorslike.me/">ColorsLike.me</a>,
<a href="http://www.stockpodium.com">StockPodium</a> and <a href="http://autotag.me/">AutoTag.me</a>
were built with PHP, JavaScript and jQuery above a standard LAMP stack.</p>

<p>Recently Imagga also started using GPU computing with nVidia Tesla cards.
They use C++ and Python bindings for
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda">CUDA</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<blockquote><p>As an initially bootstrapping start-up we chose something that is basically free,<br/>reliable and popular - that&#8217;s why started with the LAMP stack. It proved to be<br/>stable and convenient for our web needs and we preserved it.<br/>The use of C++ is a natural choice for computational intensive tasks that we<br/>need to perform for the purpose of our core expertise - image processing. <br/>Though we initially wrote the whole core technology code from scratch, we later<br/>switched to OpenCV for some of the building blocks as it is very well optimized<br/>and continuously extended image processing library.</p><p>With the raise of affordable high-performance GPU processors and their availability<br/>in server instances, we decided it&#8217;s time to take advantage of this highly parallel<br/>architecture, perfectly suitable for image processing tasks.</p><footer><strong>Georgi Kadrev</strong></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Want More Info?</h2>

<p>If you’d like to hear more from Imagga please comment below.
I will ask them to follow this thread and reply to your questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://retidoc.com/">RETiDoc</a> automates personal ID data entry, speeding up
customer service and eliminating costly errors. The product is based on OCR
algorithms and could be used on hardware devices scanning the ID card or
through a compact scanner box specially designed for the need. The main problem
tackled by RETiDoc is manual data entry at service providers,
which is a time consuming, low-customer satisfaction process, filled with
expensive typos and low productivity at provider’s front offices.</p>

<p>Co-founder Martin Kulov takes us behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Main Technologies</h2>

<p>RETiDoc is the second start-up featured on this blog to rely heavily on
Microsoft technologies. Software development is done in C# using
Visual Studio and <a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/">Team Foundation Service</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Test Manager is used to organize the test process!</p>

<h2>Why Not Something Else?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately this section is missing. The original format of this blog
is for the start-up founders or head of IT to tell the readers what factors
led to selection of the named technologies. RETiDoc team is busy at the moment,
working on their product launch and don&#8217;t have the time to fill-in the details.</p>

<p>Hopefully they will do so in the future.</p>
